    Revert "root: Make sure cairo doesn't cache our temporary connection" (FS#1245)
    
    This reverts commit c1cb7883b596cb49b3a4fc898b29cc251c1d72b8.
    
    The cairo surface used for uploading the wallpaper doesn't use a temporary
    connection but is on our main connection since commit 5024843e9. Thus, the above
    commit broke all of our cairo drawing instead of just making cairo not touch our
    temporary connection.

    systray: Don't set WM_STATE on embedded windows (FS#1246)
    
    Apparently there is no spec which requires doing this and other systray
    implementations do not do this.

    awful.tooltip: Add (and use) :set_markup() function
    
    Since commit 5b4666432f60028bda51ed, we use set_text() instead of set_markup()
    on the tooltip's textbox. This means it is no longer possible to use pango
    markup in the tooltip which was not intended.
    
    Fix this (properly) by introducing a :set_markup() function on tooltips (and use
    it in the timer function to restore the old behavior).

    awful.tooltip: Small reorganization
    
    This inlines the set_defaults() function into its only caller and makes us less
    stupid with the font property.

    gears.color: Add a pattern cache
    
    This makes gears.color() cache patterns in a weak table and returns that cached
    pattern when we get called with the same argument again.
    
    To benchmark this change, the following code was used:
    
    local time = require("socket").gettime
    
    function benchmark(func)
       local begin = time()
       local iter = 0
       while time() - begin < 1 do
          func()
          iter = iter + 1
       end
       return iter
    end
    
    for _, arg in pairs({
       "#00aa00",
       "solid:#00aa00",
       "radial:50,50,10:55,55,30:0,#ff0000:0.5,#00ff00:1,#0000ff",
       "linear:1,2:3,4:0,#000000:1,#ffffff",
       "png:/home/psychon/Wallpaper/Bars.png",
       { type = "solid", color = "#00aa00" },
       { type = "radial", from = { 50, 50, 10 }, to = { 55, 55, 30 }, stops = { { 0, "#ff0000" }, { 0.5, "#00ff00" }, { 1, "#0000ff" } } },
       { type = "linear", from = { 1, 2 }, to = { 3, 4 }, stops = { { 0, "#000000" }, { 1, "#ffffff" } } },
       { type = "png", file = "/home/psychon/Wallpaper/Bars.png" },
    }) do
       collectgarbage("collect")
       print(benchmark(function() gears.color.create_pattern(arg) end), arg)
    end
    
    Before this change (larger numbers are better, this measures how many times we
    can create the given pattern per second):
    
    29525   #00aa00
    29344   solid:#00aa00
    3446    radial:50,50,10:55,55,30:0,#ff0000:0.5,#00ff00:1,#0000ff
    4845    linear:1,2:3,4:0,#000000:1,#ffffff
    32855   png:/home/psychon/Wallpaper/Bars.png
    29883   table: 0x1bb67e0
    3868    table: 0x1bb6830
    5339    table: 0x1bb6c60
    32772   table: 0x1bb6fe0
    
    After this change:
    
    126188  #00aa00
    125962  solid:#00aa00
    125125  radial:50,50,10:55,55,30:0,#ff0000:0.5,#00ff00:1,#0000ff
    125213  linear:1,2:3,4:0,#000000:1,#ffffff
    113659  png:/home/psychon/Wallpaper/Bars.png
    125586  table: 0x1232680
    125249  table: 0x12326d0
    125468  table: 0x1232b00
    113711  table: 0x1232e80
    
    As you see, this makes some cases about 35 times faster (although I have to
    admit that something like this can be expected from such a synthetic benchmark).

    gears.surface: Cache files from disk
    
    Instead of loading files from disk every time we need them, add a cache to
    gears.surface as a weak table that maps strings to cairo surfaces.
    
    If this cache should be avoided, there is a new gears.surface.load_uncached()
    function which works just like gears.surface.load() worked before.
