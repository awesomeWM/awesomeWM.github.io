    Thanks for the kind comments and for your quick reply, I'm glad you
    find this contribution useful.
    
    I also noticed that in the previous patch there is a line that was not
    supposed to be there, since its purpose was to help debugging the
    cmake file. My apologies for that: I have removed it and attached the
    corresponding patch (against the already patched version).

    Basic support for manpages in multiple languages
    
    The patch changes the path where the manual pages are compiled, resulting in
    a tree structure that follows the man-db convention: the man pages of each
    language are stored in a subdirectory of the main man path. For example, the
    input file "$AWESOME_SRC/manpages/awesome.1.fr.txt" would be compiled as
    "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/fr/man1/awesome.1". The installation step just copies
    the resulting directory (in the example, "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/") into the
    global man path of the system, excluding the temporary files.
    
    The input .txt files for the translations are not added directly to
    AWE_MAN_FILES: instead, the new variable AWE_MAN_LANGS stores the language
    names and their input file names are generated automatically. The main
    reason of this modification is that it was more convenient for my testing
    purposes: this behaviour can be changed back with minor modifications to the
    code. This patch is supposed to be a first draft, after all, and it is far
    from being perfect, but I hope it is of help.

    Use WM_STATE_NORMAL as default
    
    If a window didn't have a WM_STATE set, xwindow_get_state_reply() returned 0
    which just happened to be XCB_WM_STATE_WITHDRAWN. This caused issues in scan().
    
    Instead, we now assume a window is in state normal if no state is explicitly
    set, which makes a lot more sense and fixes actual bugs.

    Check for UNMAPPED instead of UNVIEWABLE
    
    A window is unmapped if it is not mapped (oh noes! ;). If it is mapped, it can
    be either mapped or unviewable. If any of its ancestors is unmapped, it's
    unviewable, else it's unmapped
    
    Since this code looks at children of the root window, it should never be seeing
    clients which are unviewable (can one unmap the root window at all...?). What
    this really wants to check for is unmapped, so this patch implements this.

    a color from your stack color group.

    awful.wibox: update struts on align()
    
    Setting width or height (horizontal or vertical) to an arbitrary value
    causes the wibox not to be stretched. Instead the align() function is
    called, which might not modify any wibox property in many situations,
    or none when align parameter was not provided by the user. The major
    side effect is that wibox struts were never updated and clients
    covered the wibox (until a first signal handler caused struts to be
    updated).

    Fix possible memory corruption (FS#734)
    
    The memory referred to by the reply argument of
    property_update_wm_protocols is automatically free'd
    by xcb later on, so it is not safe to simply use the
    value of reply in our own data structures. If we did
    this, future calls to xcb_get_wm_protocols_reply_wipe
    free the data which has already been free'd by xcb,
    causing a double-free and corrupting the heap. In
    addition, it isn't safe to use free'd memory as if
    it is still allocated. Instead, duplicate the data
    referred to by reply and use the duplicate instead.
    
    It seems to me as if the duplication should actually
    be done in xcb_get_wm_protocols_from_reply, but I'm
    not really sure. If that is the case, this is simply
    a work-around until xcb can be fixed.

    Changing the width or height of a (right or bottom positioned)wibox,
