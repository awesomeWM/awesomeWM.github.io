    awful.client.setslave: Fix for not-visible clients
    
    Previously, setslave() put a client only at the end of the list of visible
    clients. Obviously this means that it didn't do anything helpful if the target
    client was not visible.
    
    Fix this by iterating over all clients on the target screen instead of just the
    visible ones.

    Taglist: Add {bg,fg}_occupied theme options
    
    This commit adds a new {bg,fg}_occupied option to the taglist. These control the
    background and foreground color that unselected but occupied tags get in the
    taglist. Occupied here means that at least one client is tagged with that tag.
    
    Thanks to NougatRillettes for submitting this.

    Focus history: Don't ignore unfocusable clients
    
    The only caller of focus.history.add() should be the "focus" signal, so at that
    time the unfocusable client already does have the focus. At that point, there is
    no reason why this shouldn't be recorded in the focus history.
    
    (And yes, unfocusable clients can be focused. Don't ask.)
    
    This should hopefully fix FS#778.

    clients and tags).

    Initialize floating_geometry on property::border_width signal (FS#826)
    
    Initializing the client property "floating_geometry" on the
    property::geometry signal is problematic since this is emitted before
    client_set_border_width(), causing the internal client geometry to get
    stored and later passed to client:geometry() which assumes it includes
    titlebar and borders.
