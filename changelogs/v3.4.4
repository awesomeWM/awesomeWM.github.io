    awful.widget: add progressbar set_max_value property
    
    The awful.widget.graph allows to change the maximum value a graph can
    handle, thus allows users to use widgets and scripts that don't scale
    the values down to 0 - 1 range. The progressbars did not allow this
    and worked with a hard-coded value of 1.

    awsetbg: add fvwm-root support
    
    fvwm-root is a part of the FVWM window manager, and is one of those
    utilities that properly support transparency because it can retain and
    publish the Pixmap with which the background has been set. It supports
    XBM, XPM, PNG and SVG image formats, but is not very rich in options
    as opposed to habak or feh.

    awful.menu: sanitize support for access keys
    
    Commit 87070ca introduced support for access keys in menus. Chosen
    character was "&", an XML entity that has potential to cause problems;
    if a user tries to add multiple access keys or just put an ampersand
    in the name of the item the menu will break. Breaking happened because
    ampersands were not escaped - first one was substituted and the rest
    were ignored, but not escaped which triggered a pango markup error.

    awful.menu: support for access keys
    
    You can define a menuitem like before:
    
    awful.menu({ items = { { "&awesome", myawesomemenu,
    	 		    beautiful.awesome_icon },
                           { "open &terminal", terminal },
    	   })
    
    and the letters following the ampersand in itemname can be used as
    access key. (at least former fvwm users might find this familiar)
    
    When there are submenus open awesome ascends during the search from the
    current menu to the top level menu.
    
    The access key is shown underlined.
    
    There is no warning for multiple used keys, only the first one found
    gets the price.

    naughty: add suspend() and resume()
    
    This commit adds naughty.suspend() and naughy.resume() which allow
    suspension of notifications, which is useful e.g. when watching a movie,
    where notifications popping up all the time would be disturbing.
    
    While suspended, notifications are collected and displayed after
    naughty.resume() is called.

    awful.rules: fix client tagging with multiple screens
    
    Commit a757dda replaced the awful.client.movetotag call with c:tags()
    in the tag property handler. Which introduced a regression when more
    than one screen is used. The awful.tag.withcurrent function was being
    called even when there was a valid tag property. Now the clients
    screen is set to the tag screen to ensure the client is moved to the
    correct tag and screen.

    awful.autofocus: improve client focus with multiple screens
    
    Changing screen focus to an empty tag leaves focus on a client on the
    previous screen, if a tag with clients is focused next the focus
    remains on the previous screen. Now awful.autofocus compares the tag
    screen and clients screen to learn if the focus should be given to a
    client on the focused screen. Client that gets the focus is selected
    from history, as usual.

    Handle synthetic UnmapNotify events *correctly*
    
    Second try:
    
    Turns out I messed up with XCB_EVENT_SENT() and had a "!" too much. The old code
    already tried to cope with this, but forgot to actually unmap the window which
    it just set to withdrawn state.
    
    This time I tested the patch *again* and now I found even less bugs than on my
    last try.
    
    P.S.: I suck.

    new() there is a check to see if one of them was a screen percentage,
    and is expected to be a string. If the user provided absolute pixels,
    and argument is of type number awesome will crash. Now tostring is
    used to sanitize the arguments during this check.

    wibox: fix align
    
    awful.wibox.align() in 3.4.x gets the available screen area from
    capi.screen[screen].geometry.
    
    this can easily result in overlapping wiboxes since the work area
    provided does not account for existing wiboxes.
    
    In my configuration I use a vertical wibox positioned at the
    right and it half-overlaps my top wibox because it is streched and
    hard-coded to align at the middle.
