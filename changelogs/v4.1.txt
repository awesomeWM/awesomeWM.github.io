    Partly fix removal of systray from a wibox
    
    This commit changes the systray widget, wibox.drawable and the C code to
    fix the following bug: When the systray widget is removed from a
    drawable without being moved somewhere else, the systray stayed visible.
    This was because the systray is not drawn by awesome, but only placed.
    When the widget is no longer "drawn", it stays wherever it was placed
    last.
    
    This change works by detecting the situation when the systray is
    removed. Then, the C code is specifically told to remove the systray
    window from the drawable.
    
    Note that this is only a partial fix. This change works correctly when
    the widget is removed completely, because it is no longer placed by its
    parent widget. However, for example, when you do
    wibox.widget.systray().visible = false, the effect is just that the
    systray widget gets size 0x0. This is not really visible, but as far as
    this change is concerned, the widget is still part of the drawable.

    awful.screen: extract screen:get_next_in_direction() (#1597)
    
    This extracts the code for finding the next screen
    from focus_bydirection to a separate method on
    the screen object.
    
    The main reason was to use the finding code without
    actually changing the screen focus but this should
    incidentally make the code slightly easier to test
    as well since both concerns can be tested in
    isolation.

    Use only_on_screen in the declarative layout example
    
    This is a follow-up to 052cda939b8a5ce1. Expressions like 's.index == 2'
    and 's == screen.primary' might work at first. However, they are not
    "dynamic": If screens are added/removed or the primary screen changes,
    then the widgets are not updated to follow this.
    
    Instead, the example now uses the new awful.widget.only_on_screen
    container which provides the needed dynamic behaviour.
    
    This is arguably "the real fix" to #1562 and #1565.

    Deprecate menubar.get()
    
    The function seems useless and its documentation is wrong. It does not
    return a wibox, but a widget. Also, the widget cannot really be used on
    its own since it depends on the size of the wibox.
    
    So menubar.get() and its wrapper through the metatable __call should
    just be removed. Until then, the needed initialisation code is moved
    around a bit and the function is deprecated.

    * wibar: Add beautiful variables
    
    This was done a few weeks ago for the notifications. This was
    requested on IRC a while ago to have different font for the wibars.
    
    Now that shapes are supported, it also makes more sense for the
    border.

    Test that beautiful is not used too early (#1471)
    
    For loading a theme, beautiful.init() has to be called. We do not handle
    dynamic changes of the theme, so if the theme is changed after something
    was already queried, this change will not apply. This also means that
    before the theme is loaded, nothing useful can be returned. In fact,
    code that tries to access the theme during require() will never get a
    useful value from beautiful, but just nils.
    
    To catch this, one Travis build is modified so that an error is raised
    if the theme is accessed before beautiful.init() was called.

    Add a utility checking uses of require()s
    
    Currently, "everything can require everything". It's an unstructured
    mess which sometimes causes problems.
    
    This commit adds a tool that enforces a white-list of require() uses. It
    uses depgraph to scan the source code and then each use of require()
    that is found is checked. If any violations are found, the tool returns
    a failure.
    
    This tool is wired up to a new target "make check-requires" which is
    included in "make check". Thus, Travis will run this.

    tests: Break wibox for multiscreen tests (on purpose)
    
    This commit add an option to shim the whole wibox module when
    running multi-screen tests. This is intended to lower the test
    runtime when coverage is enabled.
    
    In theory, most of that code is already covered by the
    test-screen-changes suit.
    
    This makes the coverage builds about twice as fast. This is
    necessary because there is a large number of timeouts due to
    limited resources on the Travis build system.

    in awful.placement. However this version never implemented
    combining multiple mementos into 1.
    
    This commit unify the maximize C code, drop the ugly macro
    template and actually fixes a couple more issues that were
    caused because request::geometry was sent twice.

    There is already a way to prevent them from moving them, but the
    next few commits will remove it. There is no reasons to handle

    Fix client shape handling
    
    The functions awful.client.shape.update.bounding and .clip handle both
    the client's shape and the shape set by Lua. However,
    awful.client.shape.update.all only handles the shape set by Lua and
    ignores the client's own shape. This can easily be noticed with xeyes.
    When update.all ran last and you move around xeyes, the wallpaper behind
    it is moved along, because it is not actually outside of the window.
    
    Fix this by partly reverting 1a5f6b7ad208e1a and having update.all just
    call the other two functions again.

    Refactor config fallback
    
    Before this, there was a function which attempted to load different
    configuration files in the right order. There was a boolean argument
    that decided if we are actually loading it or just checking for syntax
    error (for the --check argument of awesome). This lead to some
    not-so-nice code since we do not want to fall-back to another config
    when checking for syntax errors.
    
    Refactor this so that there is now a function which calls a callback
    function with the different paths that should be tried. This function
    returns as soon as the callback function returns true.
    
    Since just checking if the config syntax is ok does not depend on any
    Lua state, an empty Lua state is now used for this.

    Print full RandR version in --version output
    
    All versions of libxcb provide at least RandR 1.3 (if I remember
    correctly). With version 1.5, the concept of a monitor was added. This
    might make quite a difference for awesome and to help debugging bug
    reports that are due to missing support for monitors, the existence of
    this support was added to the --version output.
    
    However, many people feel like they are missing out due to this, even
    though the new RandR 1.5 stuff likely makes no difference for them. To
    help these people, instead of having a yes/no, just print the full RandR
    version. When a bug report that is due to missing monitor support shows
    up, we can look up if the reporter has RandR 1.5. All other people are
    no longer bothered.

    porting-tip: Mitigate a bug in the discount MarkDown parser.
    
    Some `+` and `-` were missing because it re-indented the content
    based on the first code line. It then truncated whatever was
    below.
    
    Pushing this to master because Ubuntu/Z, Debian/Sid and Arch just
    upgraded to 4.0 and angry reports are coming in *fast*.

    the other only has predefined properties.

    Modify package.cpath (#1371)

    * Refactor modification of package.path
    
    Awesome adds various entries to package.path during startup. This commit
    moves that into a helper function. No functional changes intended. The

    lua_type(L, -1);.

    Fix "make package" with RPMs (#1370)
    
    In contrast do dpkg, rpm tracks which package created a directory. No
    idea what happens if you remove the package which owns the directory,
    but another package still owns files in there. Anyway, this behaviour
    produced the following problem:
    
        file /etc/xdg from install of awesome-[snip].x86_64 conflicts with
        file from package filesystem-3.2-37.fc24.x86_64
    
    Fix this by telling CPack to exclude these directories from the file
    list.

    CMakeLists.txt: use source dir with check-unit/check-unit-coverage
    
    The build files do not get updated on source changes currently anyway
    (as a dependency of these targets), and this seems to be a leftover from
    when `lua.in` files were used / pre-processing was required?!

    ci: overhaul coverage processing
    
     - Execute the tests without compiling, and don't mess with the source
       files when coverage is enabled.
       This ensures that the coverage report lines are correct.
       This disables the doc tests, as their results would be unused.
       Hack: it still expands macros on util.lua, because of
       `util.get_themes_dir()` and `util.get_awesome_icon_dir()`, which might
       be moved later.  Ref:
       https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/pull/1239#discussion_r93828178.
     - ensure that BUILD_APIDOC and DO_COVERAGE are not used together
     - awesomeConfig.cmake: add DO_COVERAGE as an option
     - Travis: only install codecov with DO_COVERAGE=codecov
     - Travis: do not use set -v; use set -x with DO_COVERAGE
     - do not use trailing slashes with dirs in tests/examples/CMakeLists.txt / .luacov
     - Use latest luacov (0.12.0-1) again
       This reverts parts of 4cc6a815.
       I think it is better to fix any failure that 4cc6a815 tried to work around.
     - Travis: simplify/fix require('luacov') for functionaltests
     - tests/examples/CMakeLists.txt: resolve ../.. in SOURCE_DIR
     - tests/examples/CMakeLists.txt: add DO_COVERAGE to env
     - Cleanup/simplify .luacov: work with SOURCE_DIRECTORY alone
     - tests/run.sh: pass through / set SOURCE_DIRECTORY when running awesome
     - tests/run.sh: resolve source_dir

    Print warnings on invalid resizes
    
    These warnings might help catching some problems in the future. These
    could be asserts, but printing a warning is a lot nicer than dying.

    Refuse attempts to resize clients to invalid size
    
    X11 does not allow to resize a window to size 0x0. Also, there are some
    possibilities of integer overflows in our case. We tried to handle this
    already, but there was a loop-hole: If the too-small-value is only
    produced after applying size hints, then this was not caught.
    
    Fix this by applying size hints before checking if the resulting size is
    valid. However, this means some check needs to be duplicated to handle
    the possibility of integer underflows while applying size hints.

    test client: Add support for setting some size hints
    
    This adds a new argument to the test client spawning function that will
    make the test client window set a resize increment property.
    
    The API here is starting to a bit ugly, but since this is not any user
    facing API, that should not be a problem.

    Fix tests/run.sh
    
    Commit a944636c0281314ef "bashified" tests/run.sh for some reason.
    Afterwards, commit 4abd820051d3e4b09d fixed some of the fall-out.
    However, there is still a problem left.
    
    We have "set -e" in this script. Thus, whenever some command exits with
    status 0, the script abort. When the variable errors is zero/unset, the
    command "((errors++))" has exit status zero. Thus, this instruction
    caused the shell script to abort. This was not intended.
    
    Fix this by using "((++errors))" instead.

    tests/_runner.lua: Use less waiting
    
    Before this, the test runner used a timer which fired every 0.1 seconds
    to "do its thing". Many of these waits seem unnecessary.
    
    This commit makes the test runner wait 0 seconds for the first call of a
    step function. Only following calls will have a timeout of 0.1 seconds
    applied.
    
    A full run of the test suite (tests/run.sh without further arguments)
    took about 100 seconds before this change. After this change, we are
    down to 60 seconds. This is almost factor two faster! (Well, five thirds
    is the exact number, so factor 1.66)
    
    (The numbers are best out of three runs. The "before" number is rounded
    down while the "after" number is rounded up.)

    Add awesome.sync()
    
    This function should only be necessary for the test suite. It makes sure
    that the X11 server received and handled all previous requests that
    awesome sent. This will be needed, for example, in tests that use
    root.fake_input().
    
    After a call to awesome.sync(), we are sure that "faking input" has been
    done and the next main loop iteration will handle the input event.
    Without the sync, it could happen that the X11 server did not yet fake
    the input in the next iteration.

    menubar: Fix refresh without show
    
    When menubar.refresh() is called, it tries to update the menubar widget.
    The call chain looks like this: menulist_update -> common.list_update ->
    get_current_page. get_current_page then tries to query information about
    the size of the menubar.
    
    Since there is not much point in this, just skip the whole callback in
    this case.
    
    Side note: What is the point of menubar.get()? It seems quite useless to

    Specify USES_TERMINAL for running tests/run.sh (#1331)
    
    The documentation for CMake's add_custom_command()-command says the
    following for USES_TERMINAL:
    
      The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
      With the ``Ninja`` generator, this places the command in the
      ``console`` ``pool``.
    
    The result is that one can see the progress of tests/run.sh, because
    messages appear immediately instead of delayed (instead all other
    parallel steps are delayed; in practice this means luacheck output
    appears only after tests/run.sh is done).

    for an overview of the available key bindings, this now mentions Mod4+S.
    
    The "Add widgets"-section is just a todo. The wiki page refers to
    Vicious which does not really work for our api documentation. However, I
    also didn't want to just drop this part.

    wibox: Add shape property
    
    This bridges between gears.shape and the shapes. So far, it does not try
    to do any kind of anti-aliasing magic, so you get "steep edges".
