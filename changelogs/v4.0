    Small cleanup to test-spawn.lua
    
    This removes a duplicate test and moves some "spawn with empty string as
    argument" up to the long list of similar tests (and adds error
    checking).
    
    I do not see the point of the assert(#client.get() == 0) and so it was
    just dropped.

    Fix error handling in awesome.spawn()
    
    Commit 5e6a893 broke error handling in awesome.spawn(): Instead of
    returning an error message, it would just return its last argument.
    
    This commit fixes that, removes some not-so-helpful warnings, and adds
    lots of tests for this code.

    Sync instead of flush after setting a wallpaper (#1278)
    
    When setting a wallpaper, we open a second connection to the X11 server
    and create a pixmap there. This pixmap is then used as the wallpaper. We
    do this so that we can use a "close down mode" called "permanent". This
    means that the X11 server will not free the pixmap after we disconnect,
    but keeps it allocated. Setting this close down mode is the last thing
    that we do on the setup-the-wallpaper-connection before disconnecting.
    
    However, sometimes things didn't work around. The wallpaper was missing
    and trying to query it resulted in errors that basically mean "there is
    no such pixmap". Thus, the symptoms say that the close down mode did not
    work.
    
    This commit is an attempt to fix this. Instead of just flushing before
    closing the connection (sending all outstanding requests to the server),
    this commit does a sync, which means it sends a request to the server
    and waits for a reply. This guarantees that all previously requests were
    handled.
    
    The theory here is like this: We send the SetCloseDownMode-request and
    then immediately disconnected. If the X11 server notices that we are
    disconnected before handling the SetCloseDownMode-request, the request
    would be ignored.
    
    This theory is consistent with the symptoms above and in my local
    testing this patch seems to fix things, but since the error only
    appeared sporadically, I cannot be 100% sure. Still, it all seems to
    make sense to me.

    wibox.drawable: Support forced screens
    
    Up to now, a drawable always figured out the screen that it is on by
    looking at its position. This causes memleak-like problems with wibars:
    A wibar has a screen assigned, but its underlying drawable will end up
    referring to another screen. Via this, we were managing to build a long
    reference chain of screens and drawable that meant that none of the fake
    screens that our test suite added could be garbage collected.
    
    To fix this, add wibox.drawable._force_screen(s). After this function is
    called, the normal screen detection based on the position is skipped and
    instead the given screen is always used. This breaks the above reference
    chain and things become garbage-collectable.
    
    Also, this chains the drawable to the life time of the screen: When the
    screen becomes invalid (.valid == false), the drawable will stop
    redrawing.

    doc: Document the client layouts. (#1247)
    
    This commit doesn't add any useful documentation, but adds
    previously hidden documentation variables. It can be the basis
    of a better layout documentation.

    Handle unexpected XCB failures (#1260)
    
    We have many places where we are sending an XCB request and expect an
    answer where the protocol guarantees that no error can occur and we are
    sure to get an answer. However, for example if the X11 server crashes,
    these places can still fail. This commit tries to handle failures at all
    these places.
    
    I went through the code and tried to add missing error checking (well,
    NULL-pointer-checking) to all affected places.
    
    In most cases these errors are just silently ignored. The exception is
    in screen querying during startup. If, for example, querying RandR info
    fails, we will fall back to Xinerama or zaphod mode. This is serious
    enough that it warrants a warning. In most cases, we should exit shortly
    afterwards anyway, because, as explained above, these requests should
    only fail when our connection to the X11 server breaks.

    awful.wibox.stretch: Spell out full replacement
    
    The function that is documented as awful.wibox.stretch is deprecated,
    because it was removed (that's not a deprecation, is it?!?). For the
    replacement, we used "@see stretch". However, LDoc was randomly
    resolving this reference to awful.wibar.stretch (good) or
    awful.wibox.stretch (bad; the see points to the element where it
    appears).
    
    Fix this by spelling out the "full name" of the function in the @see.

    Add pointless naughty.lua and beautiful.lua files (#1259)
    
    People who use a plain "make install" to install awesome will likely
    also use the same approach to update their installation. However, this
    does not actually work, because in awesome 3.5 there are beautiful.lua
    and naughty.lua. These modules have since been split up into multiple
    files and we now have beauitful/init.lua and naughty/init.lua instead.
    The result is that the newer awesome will use some code from an older
    version of awesome.
    
    This commit has a work-around for this: We add "empty" beautiful.lua and
    naughty.lua files whose only purpose is to load the real file. These
    "empty" files will then overwrite files from an older installation and
    everything works.
    
    Sadly, this bad hack will have to be kept around forever and in the
    future we will only have more instances of it. I would like to just say
    people to fix their system, but apparently this should be worked around
    instead.

    Make the piechart deterministic (#1258)
    
    Previously, the API to set the data that should be displayed was
    :set_data(t) where t is a table. This table has the labels to use as its
    keys and the numbers as its values. With this API, it was not possible
    to influence the order in which the "pie pieces" were drawn.
    
    This commit adds and uses a new API called :set_data_list(t). Here, t is
    a table with integer keys and tables as values, thus one can iterate
    over this with ipairs() and the order is well-defined. The tables used
    as values contain the label as their first entry and the number as their
    second entry.

    Make the resize_to_mouse example test deterministic (#1250)
    
    This test has a list of "things" that should be present in the output. This
    table is iterated over via pairs(), which means that the output is
    non-deterministic and the order of the entries is basically random.
    
    Fix this by using ipairs() to get a deterministic iteration order. This requires
    some slight change to the table that is iterated over.

    Guarantee stable output from 06-appearence.md.lua (#1233)
    
    This function was iterating over a table with pairs() to generate output (the
    sample theme file). Since pairs() does not guarantee any iteration order, this
    lead to a different order each time this file was generated. This is, for
    example, visible in the diffs in the generate api documentation repository.
    
    Fix this by using a self-made iteration function which behaves like pairs(), but
    guarantees an iteration order sorted by keys.

    screen: Add a "list" signal
    
    Similarly to what we do with the client list, this signal is emitted
    whenever the list of screens changes.

    Test and fix swapping clients
    
    The code in luaA_client_swap() is incorrect, because
    luaA_object_emit_signal() already pops the arguments to the signal.
    Still, the code here tried to remove the arguments from the Lua stack
    again, thereby corrupting the stack (removing more items than there are
    in the stack).
    
    Normally, popping more things from the stack than it has entries
    silently corrupts the Lua stack. Apparently this doesn't necessarily
    cause any immediate issues, because this code has been broken since nine
    months and no one noticed. This mistakes was introduced in commit
    55190646.
    
    This issue was only noticed by accident. Thus, this commit also adds a
    small integration test that exercises this bug. This test catches the
    issue, but only on Travis, because there we are building our own version
    of Lua 5.3 and that one has assertions enabled.

    awful.spawn: Separate rules from callbacks (#1186)
    
    When adding callbacks as a `callback` entry in a property, the callback
    is run by `awful.rules`, because it does `c.callback =
    result_of_function`. This is obviously not intended. Also, this causes
    the callbacks to run twice, because the code already handled this
    `callback` property specially.
    
    Fix this by just not merging callbacks with the normal rules at all.

    Ignore warnings from ldoc by default
    
    A while ago, we made errors from ldoc fatal by default. Then a new ldoc
    release appeared and caused problems for all of our users, because
    awesome failed to work.
    
    This patch reverts the previous fix so that we ignore ldoc warnings by
    default again. However, to catch ldoc warnings on Travis, another
    ldoc-building-target is added that fails on warnings. This new target is
    included in our "check" target.
    
    This fixes the intend of issue #1098 ("Users with ldoc version X cannot
    build awesome"), but it does not actually employ the solution proposed
    there ("Blacklist those ldoc versions"). Still, since this fixes the
    intend of the issue, I count it as fixed.

    Check for pending events after the main loop (#1163)
    
    At the beginning of every main loop iteration, we check for new events
    from the X11 server. However, it's theoretically possible that during a
    main loop iteration new events arrive and are read by libxcb into its
    internal buffer. This would mean that the fd connected to the X11 server
    is not readable and thus we do not wake up to handle these events.
    
    Handle this by checking for pending events before calling poll(). If a
    new events appears, we set the timeout for poll() to zero and will then
    handle the new event in the following iteration of the main loop.

    menubar.utils: Use a protected call (#1174)
    
    When awesome calls any Lua code, it does so with a protected call. This
    means that any kind of Lua error should (there are exceptions) just
    result in an error message being printed and everything continuing as
    usual. When LGI calls Lua code, it uses a normal call. This means that
    in an asynchronous context, that is, when there is no more call
    generated by awesome's C code on the call stack, we must be careful,
    since any error results in Awesome's unprotected error handler to be
    called which restarts the WM.
    
    menubar.utils.parse_dir() asynchronously parses a directory containing
    .desktop files. This means that it is no longer in a protected call
    context. Let's assume that the code itself is fine. However, the
    callback that the caller provided for handling the results can be quite
    arbitrary. Make sure that it is run in a protected context.

    Delay client frame window destruction (#1148)
    
    Daniel sees a short flicker of his wallpaper when he closes a client.
    This happens because the window is destroyed immediately, but other
    clients are re-arranged only shortly later. In the mean time, the X
    server updates the display and repaints the root window (= wallpaper
    becomes visible).
    
    Work around this by delaying the destruction of frame windows to the end
    of the current main loop iteration. This means that we first update the
    position of all other windows and later destroy the window that was
    actually closed.

    Fix short flicker when new clients appear (#1138)
    
    We are doing more and more things lazily in the C code. The newest
    addition is lazily configuring clients, which means that geometry
    changes are only applied later.
    
    However, this caused a short flicker when a new client appears: We were
    first making the client visible and then moving it to its "proper"
    position.
    
    Since unbanning is also done lazily, we just have to change the order in
    which we apply these operations to fix this.

    Change API for wibox.drawable:find_widgets()
    
    Instead of matrix_to_device and matrix_to_parent, this now provides the
    full hierarchy instance managing the current widget.
    
    In addition to x, y, width and height (which are an over-approximation
    of the widget's extents on the drawable), this now also provides
    widget_width and widget_height in the widget's local coordinate system.
    These last two values are exact.
    
    For example, the tooltip needs x/y/width/height while a widget that
    wants to figure out which point on it was hit with a mouse press will
    need widget_width and widget_height (together with the position argument
    that is passed in with mouse::press).
    
    I don't know how to document the return type of this function properly.
    Hopefully just describing the structure of the resulting table is good
    enough.

    Similar to the previous commit, this makes the drawable not apply a
    pending relayout while it is not visible. When it becomes visible again,
    the relayout is done.
    
    The hope here is that less work is done while a drawable is not visible,
    saving CPU time.

    wibox.drawable: Fix a possible crash
    
    LGI does not protect against use-after-free issues that can occur due to
    using an object after finalisation. This manifests itself as occasional
    crashes on Travis in cairo_region_union_rectangle() (AFAIK no one ran
    into this issue in real-world usage).
    
    Since visible drawables are always strongly reachable, the issue can
    only occur with invisible drawables. The previous commit made sure that
    those are fully repainted when they become visible, so we can just
    ignore redraws for those and fix the crash issue.

    wibox.drawable: Stop using weak tables
    
    Instead of tracking all drawables that are alive, the code now only
    tracks visible drawables. When a drawable is made visible it is
    completely repainted. This should not cause a difference when a wibox is
    initially made visible, because it has to be redrawn anyway. However,
    this introduces a full repaint when a wibox is hidden and then made
    visible again.
    
    Thanks to this change, we can stop using weak tables. Visible drawables
    cannot be collected and so we can keep a strong reference to them. This
    allows us to get rid of the weak tables which solves various problems
    involving finalizers and using objects after finalisation.

    This new function is called whenever the visibility of the drawable

    Fix memory leak in the default config on screen removal
    
    The default config had tables like mywibox and mywibox[s] was the wibox
    that is visible on screen s. When a screen is removed, nothing cleans up
    these tables and so the screen and the wibox could not be garbage
    collected. The same applies to the layoutbox, taglist etc.
    
    This commit removes the global mywibox table and instead saves it as a
    property on the screen. This way, the screen is not explicitly
    referenced and when it is removed, the screen, its wibox and all of its
    widgets become unreachable and can be garbage collected.
    
    This commit also updates the docs and the tests that referenced things
    (mostly the wibox) via mywibox[s] to now use s.mywibox.

    gears.object.properties: Use the new .data table
    
    Previously, gears.object.properties used a weak table for adding
    additional information to a C object. However, weak tables can easily
    cause leaks when the value references the key.
    
    This commit makes the code instead use the new .data property that is
    available on all C objects. This means we have no more magic with a weak
    table and instead only use "regular" tables instead.

    C: Add a .data table to all C objects
    
    This table is "just a normal Lua table". Lua code can use it in whatever
    way it wants to store things related to a given C object.
    
    An object (userdata) already references a "plain Lua table" via
    lua_setuservalue() / lua_setfenv(). This is used to keep a reference to
    signal functions that are connected to an object. The signal code only
    uses lightuserdata keys in this table. This commit adds an entry with
    key "data" to this table which just references another table. This is
    the table that is made available as .data.
    
    Via this .data property, Lua code can add own properties to C objects
    without having to use, for example, weak tables. The weak tables have
    the downside that they produce a leak if the value references the key.
    The new .data property does not have any such problem (no weak
    references are involved).
    
    This new data property is not documented, because I'd have to touch lots
    of files and I'm lazy.

    Rewrite tests/_client.lua
    
    The new client is hopefully faster. Why, you ask?
    
    Instead of spawning a new Lua process each time a test asks for a new window,
    there is a "daemon process" which gets commands to open new windows from its
    standard input. That way, Lua doesn't have to load LGI all the time and lots of
    pointless work is skipped. The daemon process exits when its stdin is closed and
    thus should automatically exit when awesome exits.

    Speed up client_ignore_enterleave_events()
    
    There are some situations where we do things that can make the mouse pointer
    enter another window. We do not want to react to these "self inflicted" mouse
    enter and leave events, because they aren't "real" (= generated by the user).
    
    Before this commit, this is done by going through all windows and toggling the
    "please send us enter and leave events"-bit on them. This becomes slower when
    many windows are visible and floods the server with requests.
    
    This commit changes this to a constant-time logic. Each event contains the
    sequence number of the last request that the X11 server handled. Thus, we just
    remember the right sequence numbers and ignore any events that comes in whose
    sequence number falls into the ignored range.
    
    In detail, we keep a list of "begin" and "end" sequence numbers and ignore any
    enter and leave events that fall in this range. If we get any event with a
    sequence number higher than "end", we remove this pair from the list, since it
    is no longer needed.
    
    To generate these pairs, we use a GrabServer request in
    client_ignore_enterleave_events(). This gives us a sequence number and makes
    sure that nothing else besides us can cause events. The server is ours! In
    client_restore_enterleave_events(), we first do a NoOperation request to
    generate the sequence number for the end of the pair and then do UngrabServer.
    Any event that is generated after UngrabServer will have at least the sequence
    number of the UngrabServer request and thus no longer fails between begin and
    end.

    drawin_map: Ignore enter/leave after apply_moveresize
    
    drawin_apply_moveresize() calls client_ignore_enterleave_events() internally,
    because it also wants these to be ignored. This means that the code disables
    enter/leave events twice and then enables them twice. This recursive disabling
    is something that should not occur.
    
    Fix this by having drawin_map() disable the events a bit later.

    Fix test-tooltip.lua: Run the event loop
    
    This test changes the mouse cursor's position and afterwards has an
    assert that checks something on the tooltip. This really looks a lot
    like it expects the mouse cursor's position to be already updated and
    its enter and leave events to be handled. However, this is now how
    things actually work.
    
    Fix this by moving the assert into its own step, so that in between the
    normal main loop runs.

    This commit also add clip support. This is enabled by default, but
    could be disabled to have the bar taller than the background.

    doc: Document rc.lua
    
    This meta-lua script takes the "raw" awesomerc.lua and turn it
    into the final file and generate a documentation page from its
    parsed content. It support
    
     * Turn {{{ into markdown categories
     * Turn top level comments into documentation
     * Add custom documentation sections
     * Parse the code to add links for each API calls
    
    This helps generate a good entry point for new users wanting to
    understand the content of rc.lua without searching the API by
    hand.
    
    Over time, this will also become the basis of the documentation.
    
    If `rc.lua` is separated into several files, this will be easy to fix
    this script. It could even do the separation itself from a monolitic
    file using the already implemented {{{ parser.

    tests/run.sh: Use dbus-send directly with low timeouts (#1116)
    
    run.sh waits for awesome's startup to be done by having awesome execute "return
    1" via its dbus interface. However, by default dbus has a 25 second timeout
    before it fails a dbus-send invocation. This defeats the purpose of this
    exercise.
    
    So instead of using awesome-client, this commit makes the code use dbus-send
    directly and specifies a relative low reply timeout (which should still be
    plenty so that this doesn't erroneously fail).

    wibox.drawable: Don't redraw invalid drawables
    
    Twice now we had problems with the garbage collector which caused signals
    established via weak_connect_signal() not to be disconnected when we wanted them
    to be disconnected. The effect was that we tried to redraw a drawable after it
    was garbage collected which caused errors.
    
    Instead of playing whack-a-mole with all the various ways that might make us
    redraw a drawable after GC, let's just fix all of these issues by explicitly
    checking for this case and turning it into a no-op.

    Improve behaviour of GC'd objects
    
    Before this commit: When we are GC'ing an object, we clear its metatable, since
    otherwise crashes could occur in various places. This means that if someone
    tries to use such an object, they get an unhelpful error message like "attempt
    to index userdata object" and they don't understand what the problem is. Also,
    this means that foo.valid does not actually work after GC.
    
    This commit changes this behaviour. Instead of setting an empty metatable, we
    now create a metatable with an __index and __newindex method. These metamethods
    produce better error messages that they sat the underlying object was already
    garbage collected. Better yet, the __index metamethod makes foo.valid be false
    instead of causing an error, so that the existing machinery for detecting
    invalid objects continues to work.
    
    This commit also adds a functional test that verifies this behaviour.

    wibox.drawable: React to screen changes
    
    The previous commit made wibox.drawable turn a "normal redraw" into a complete
    repaint when it was moved to another screen. However, nothing happened until
    that normal redraw.
    
    This commit triggers a normal redraw when we are (possibly) moved to another
    screen. More precise, this means that whenever a screen appears, disappears or
    changes its geometry and when the drawable is moved, we trigger a normal redraw.
    This redraw will likely do nothing, because no relayout is pending and no part
    of the surface needs a redraw, so it is cheap.
    
    However, if the drawable really ends up on another screen, then the code from
    the previous commits makes us do a full relayout and redraw.
    
    This commit likely fixes the current instability of test-screen-changes.lua. See
    https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/982#issuecomment-231712056.
    
    As explained there, the test fails because the fake screen that it created is
    still referenced, so cannot be garbage collected, but the test doesn't succeed
    unless the screen is garbage collected. So something is still referencing the
    screen that was removed. This something can be a client's titlebar, because the
    underlying drawable still has a context member referring to the old screen.
    
    This commit should fix that problem, because we now trigger a redraw which will
    compute a new context and thus the reference to the old screen is released.

    Fix magnifier layout when focus is on another screen
    
    The magnifier layout wants to ignore floating clients. Before 82342f0 this was
    done by calling awful.client.floating.get(focus). If "focus" was nil, this might
    have checked the floating status of a wrong client (if some other client was
    focused, and the code in magnifier set focus=nil before). This issue can easily
    be missed and might exist since forever. After 82342f, floating status is
    checked via "focus.floating" and this now causes an "attempt to index nil value"
    error instead. Much easier to notice.
    
    Fix this by adding the missing nil check and while touching the code, merge this
    with the previous "if" and correct another error (the wrong thing happened if we
    had #cls=0).

    tests: Fix awful.screen tests
    
    To ensure that some features such as SNID rules work, we need
    to ensure that the screen isn't set by other code paths. Only
    a single algorithm can be executed for the screen. As soon
    as many algorithms are executed on events such as "manage", it
    will most likely regress again.
    
    This commit make sure of that by disabling the default normal source
    of c.screen. After that, any other c.screen changes can be
    considered bugs.

    awesomerc: Explicitly select a default screen
    
    A client is supposed to go to a screen when:
    
     * It has been started using `awful.spawn` with explicit instructions [1]
     * An `awful.rules` rule **or any of its callbacks** set the screen [2]
     * When something handle `request::screen` and/or `request::tag` in some
       custom ways. [3]
     * Some clients can request a screen and mean it (like MythTV/Kodi/XBMC and
       some multi-window DAW) [4]
    
    A client is supposed to go to the focused screen when none of the above are
    true [5].
    
    Other constraints:
    
     * The screen need to be set only once, anything will will emit
       `property::screen` many time and cause side effects.
     * There has to be a single entry point to the algorithm, no multiple
       "manage" handler.
     * Awesome internals must use the `request::` signal API and not force
       their decision outside of request handlers.
     * Restarting Awesome must not change the client screen

    Test & fix a bug with dbus.disconnect_signal (#1096)
    
    The code was written so that it assumes that disconnecting the last signal also
    removed the corresponding entry in the signal array. This lead e.g. to an
    index-out-of-bounds access in some cases.

    ewmh: Remove dead code
    
    The geometry storage has been moved into awful.placement. This
    code was never executed as data[] was never populated.
    
    There is some behavior that is indeed lost, but it is unlikely
    someone will ever notice (it has been broken for 6 months).
    The previous code attempted to handle scrren changes while
    maximized. The new code organization shift this responsability
    to awful.placement. However, it doesn't yet fully implement the
    previous logic.

    Only configure client geometries once per main loop iteration
    
    This should "protect" the user from some stupidities that Lua code might be
    doing that e.g. makes a client jump to another position and then immediately
    back to where it was before. Only the last change in a single main loop
    iteration will actually have any effect.

    Compatibility tweak for minimize and 3.5 themes
    
    Awesome 3.5.9 accepts `_active`/`_inactive` names for `beautiful`
    minimize keys (such as "titlebar_minimize_button_focus_inactive").
    Some themes rely on those, meaning that when they loaded under
    the current Git, the minimize button went missing. This adds a
    fallback, to improve compatibility with the existing themes.

    While testing using "the real deal" and with all the tests would be

    This module generate multiple multi-screen scenarios and some obvious

    client: Simplify screen selection decision tree.
    
    This commit remove the `awful.tag` "manage" hook. The relevant
    code has been moved to ewmh.lua request::tag handler. The handler
    is called either by a volontary screen change or by a forced one.
    
    It also require the awful.rules to be executed. This is done by
    default and the user would have to explicitly disable that
    behavior. From now on, disabling the rules require the user to
    handle tag selection.

    awesome-client: Handle errors when running arguments
    
    Commit 78abb4a54cf58db21396cedc34f0aa46827212ff made awesome-client fail with a
    non-zero exit code when sending a command that it got from stdin failed.
    
    Commit f0f31bc305881aa0df54d66477843ffd475cb316 added the possibility to specify
    commands to run as arguments to awesome-client. However, the exit code was still
    zero even when such a command failed.
    
    This commit makes awesome-client signal errors with its exit code even for code
    specified via arguments.
    
    Note that this means that following arguments will not be executed if some
    argument fails. I do not know if this is the best behaviour or not, but I am
    implementing it like this here due to its simplicity to implement.

    awesome-client: send command line arguments to awesome (#1058)
    
    In some languages, invoking commands with command-line arguments is
    significantly simpler than setting up pipes for writing to a command's
    standard input.
    
    This adds an additional way for sending commands through awesome-client;
    so all of these will be equivalent:
    
      $ awesome-client 'awesome.restart()'
      $ echo 'awesome.restart()' | awesome-client
      $ awesome-client <<<'awesome.restart()'
      $ awesome-client
      awesome# awesome.restart()
      awesome# ^D
      $
    
    Note that this sends each command line argument as a separate message
    over dbus.

    placement: Add `next_to`
    
    This commit add the last placement function imported from the
    Radical module.
    
    It allows to place a wibox/client next to another object. It tries
    to find the best fit. It also support wibox widgets.
    
    This is intended for tooltips and menus, but can also be used in
    `awful.rules` to place the new client as close as possible to the
    focused one without overlap.

    Travis: fix return/exit usage (#1043)
    
    Return 0 (success) in do_codecov function.  It is used in "&&" chains,
    and should just do nothing for "coverall", but not break it.
    
    This also makes use of "set -ev" instead of "exit" in general.
    
    The "exit" caused the whole build to stop, but it was still green!
    https://travis-ci.org/awesomeWM/awesome/jobs/151943526
    
    "exit" is not really supported:

    Revert "screen: Fix potential nil index" (#1037)
    
    This reverts commit facf676b1367e6915235a45ce3e7ef11790b0411.
    
    Using capi.client.focus.screen to decide which screen is focused breaks
    a multiscreen setup. At least makes it extremely annoying to use.
    
    In particular, if you have a focused client on screen 1, move the mouse
    to screen 2 and launch a new client, the new client appears in screen 1,
    since screen.focused reports that current focused screen is 1, not 2
    because of the focused client.

    Make rules with 'tag = "3"' work with multiple screens (#992)
    
    The default config creates the same set of tags for all screens ("1" to "9"). An
    awful.rules-rule with e.g. screen = 2, tag = "3" should obviously tag matching
    clients with tag "3" of the second screen.
    
    However, the implementation used the first matching tag in the list of all tags
    and thus the client ended up tagged with tag "3" from screen 1. Fix this by
    calling find_by_name() with the screen that the client is assigned to.
    
    The existing implementation of awful.rules guarantees that any
    "screen"-properties are applied before the code touched by this commit is run,
    thus this should always work.
    
    This commit does not add a test catching this because we are currently quite bad
    at testing multi-screen scenarios and I don't want to invent the necessary
    machinery right now.

    missing before. However, only the default theme and xresources where fixed to
    contain the path to the image.
    
    This commit adds the path to all themes.
    
    Also, minimized clients aren't visible, just as closed (=killed) clients aren't
    visible. Thus, we don't need an "active" version of this image.
    
    This commit makes us handle the image for the minimize button just like we
    handle the close button: There is no difference between "active" and "inactive"
    and the file path in the theme doesn't get any path suffix.

    drawable: Draw bgimage with operator OVER
    
    The actual bg is drawn either with fake transparency over the wallpaper (this
    uses operator OVER) or for true transparency with operator SOURCE. The bgimage
    should be drawn ontop of this without erasing the background and thus needs
    operator OVER.
    
    However, before this commit the bgimage was drawn in the same way as the bg and
    thus inherited its SOURCE operator if a compositor is running. Fix this by
    restoring the default operator (OVER) and also e.g. the default source before
    drawing the bgimage.

    Travis: Install luacov 0.11.0-1 (#991)
    
    With luacov 0.12.0-1 our travis build fails. It was always kinda broken, but now
    this breakage is revealed.
    
    What likely happens: Our .luacov errors out because some needed environment
    variable to figure out where to put the results is not set. Due to the way we
    load luacov, it runs with its default config which luckily happens to work. With
    luacov 0.12.0-1 the error is propagated instead and the build fails.

    Correctly deny ConfigureRequests for embedded windows (#990)
    
    Since commit 4daa6e8, we are denying resizes and moves for embedded windows
    (=tray icons). However, the Xembed spec says that the embedding client acts like
    a WM (as specified by ICCCM) to the embedded window. Thus, when denying a
    configure request, we have to inform the window by sending it a synthetic
    configure notify. Otherwise, GTK seems to sometimes not draw its tray icon.

    Fix disconnecting not connected signals (#950)
    
    When a function is disconnected from a signal ("disconnect_signal") that is not
    actually connected to the function, two things happened:
    
    1. The attempt to remove the function from the signal array didn't do anything
    2. Unreferencing the function noticed that the function wasn't referenced
    
    The second step printed a big, fat scary warning.
    
    Actually, this has the possibility of causing errors. For example, in the
    following code, awesome would wrongly unreference the function at the
    disconnect_signal() call and might later still try to call it when the
    "refresh" signal is emitted:
    
    do
        local function f() end
        awesome.connect_signal("refresh", f)
        awesome.disconnect_signal("debug::error", f)
    end
    
    Fix this by making signal_disconnect() return a boolean value indicating if it
    actually did something. All callers are fixed to use this value and only update
    the reference counts if something was actually disconnected.

    Fix client snapping (#951)
    
    First some reminder on how client geometries works (in X11, awesome just copied
    that!):
    
    - The position (x,y) defines where the border of the client begins
    - This means that the content starts at (x+border_width,y+border_width)
    - However, the size is the size of the client without border
    - Thus, the client covers the rectangle from (x,y) to (x+2*bw,y+2*bw)
    
    The client snapping code got this wrong. It only deals with rectangles and thus
    for things to work as expected, the width/height have to be increased by two
    times the border width. When snapping a client against other visible clients,
    the geometry of the client to snap against wasn't calculated correctly.
    
    This was apparently noticed at one point and worked around by decreasing the
    position by two times the border width. While this is terribly wrong, it
    actually makes things work correctly when snapping to the right or bottom edge
    of a client, but breaks for the other edges.
    
    Fix this by just calculating things correctly.
    
    This is based on a patch from jk411.

    Fix the test that the previous commit added
    
    There was a race with autofocus. To overcome this, add another step that tests
    that moving the client back to a visible tag and focusing it updates
    _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP. Afterwards, we kill the client so that it can no longer
    interfere.

    Attempt at better handling of NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP property.
    
    NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP is now being set to the index of the tag with currently focused client.
    In case of no focused clients present, first selected tag index is taken, with fallback value being 0.
    Current desktop is updated on next client signals: focus, unfocus, tagged, untagged.
    Current desktop is also updated on tag property::selected signal.
    
    This should fix drag and drop issues with chrome-based applications on multihead setups

    "Fix" client properties which can be absent (#932)
    
    A client c could have no c.machine or no c.pid because the corresponding
    properties are not set on its window. Previously, the C code would return an
    empty string or 0 for these values. This commit makes the C code give Lua no
    value instead (not even a nil).

    menu: Fix regression
    
    There was already a bug, as self.active_child.visible
    was used instead of self.active_child.wibox.visible
    
    This caused some confusion that this attribute was a widget.
    It wasn't.

    Properly support the XEMBED_MAPPED bit
    
    The XEmbed protocol defines a special property that defines if the embedded
    window wants to be visible or not. Up to now, awesome always ignored this entry
    and instead behaved as if the bit was set. This commit makes it properly respect
    the bit.
    
    Testing done: None. No idea how. Apparently nothing really uses this bit,
    because we didn't get bug reports about it yet.

    tests: Fix coverage data
    
    As the documentation generation insert increasingly large ammount
    of code into the lua files, the coverage data is getting less and
    less accurate. This try to fix this by only collecting such data
    after the `configure_file` calls are done.

    This was only partially implemented. The margins were substracted from

    the size and substracted when setting it. This way, the margins will
    "survive" when a placement function set an absolute value in one of
    the field. Previously, this caused one (or more) of the margins to
    be lost.

    Before this commit, it was necessary to call 'rawset' to be

    This solution was choosen because wibox is itself a base class of
    menus and wibars. Those classes can now add new properties without
    hacks.

    naughty: change action markup to emphasize clickability
    
    This commit changes the markup applied to the action description text to
    emphasize the fact that the action zone is actually clickable. Bold is
    replaced with underline, the Unicode 261B symbol (right pointer) is
    added as well.

    naughty: display the client-supplied localized action description in UI
    
    According to the Desktop Notification specification document [1] the
    clients supply actions available along with a notification in a form of
    a list of pairs where first element is an identifier of an action and
    the second is a localized message that will be displayed to the user.
    
    Up to now the naughty code directly used the action identifier text as a
    part of the notification layout exposed to the user. This commit makes
    use of a localized action description for that purpose.

    Fix awful.screen.getbycoord() for top-left corner of a screen
    
    The problem was that get_square_distance() made the screen one pixel larger to
    the bottom/right than it really was. Thus, the (x+0,y+0)-pixel of a screen that
    was below or to the right of some other screen had distance zero to both of
    these screens.
    
    This commit fixes the screen size computation and adds a small unit test for
    getbycoord() and get_square_distance().

    Fix mouse clicks on titlebars (#901)
    
    Commit 7dad0b3b876af3c7 made awesome only ask for mouse events on the actual
    client window. Obviously, this means that we no longer get reports for clicks on
    the titlebar. Whoops.
    
    Fix this by asking for mouse events on *both* the actual client window and the
    frame window. The passive grab on the actual client window is actually unneeded,
    but we keep it so that the fix that was done by the above commit is still
    present (xev will no longer report leave/enter events just for a mouse click).
    
    Since we now get mouse events inside of a client reported twice, the event
    handling code in event.c has to be fixed to handle both cases. E.g. x/y are
    relative to the top-left corner of the window and thus needs to be fixed for
    titlebar size; the second click has to be ignored.

    Fix fallback for the window type
    
    EWMH specifies that
    
       If _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE is not set, then managed windows with WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
       set MUST be taken as [_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG].
    
    We implement this by forcing a window's type to be "dialog" when it has a
    WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property. For windows that have a _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE property,
    this type change is then later undone. However, when a window changes its
    WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property during runtime, then we would set its type to "dialog"
    unconditionally.
    
    This commit fixes this by explicitly tracking if we found a _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
    property on the window and only applying the fallback if we did not find such a
    property.

    Fix screen.fake_add()
    
    Commit 8a6787bd54 added screen.fake_add(). Commit 08845c7a4b made us cache a
    screen's workarea in the struct screen_t. This new member needs to be
    initialized to the screen's geometry when a new screen is added. Since both
    these commits were developed concurrently, the workarea was not initialized in
    screen.fake_add().
    
    Fix this by calling in fake_add() the helper function added in 08845c7a4b.

    gears.wallpaper: Handle concurrent screen changes
    
    The code in gears.wallpaper currently sets a wallpaper in a deferred fashion.
    Only a while after it is told to do something does it actually do the wallpaper
    change. This is to incorporate many wallpaper changes right after another. These
    changes happens during startup where the wallpaper for each screen is set one
    after another.
    
    However, since we no longer restart on RandR changes, the screen configuration
    could change while we have a pending wallpaper. In this case, part of the
    wallpaper could be "chopped off", because the surface that we draw the wallpaper
    to is too small.
    
    This commit makes gears.wallpaper track the size of the pending wallpaper and
    create a new surface if the already-pending one is too small.

    Grab buttons on the child window
    
    Since commit 102063dbbd, awesome is a reparenting WM. That means that we put our
    own frame windows around child windows. This means that we have the option of
    grabbing input events on the frame window or the child window. This commit chose
    the frame window for this.
    
    For keyboard events, this decision was already reverted in 532ec0cd90. This
    commit does the same thing for mouse events.
    
    This fixes the spurious leave/enter events that were visible on mouse clicks.
    They occurred because the click activated a passive grab (all mouse events now
    "belonged" to awesome). This passive grab caused the X server to inform clients
    that they "lost" the mouse pointer (with the detail field set to "a grab
    activated").

    drawin: Add a get_wibox function
    
    As wibox contain a drawin, but isn't one, it is necessary to map
    drawin to wibox.
    
    This could eventually be fixed by turning wibox into drawin just
    like the client, tag and screen do.

    Add a screen checker.
    
    A client cannot be used any more after it was unmanaged. Similarly, Lua
    shouldn't be allowed to e.g. assign a client to a screen that was removed. This
    commit adds such a checker which "breaks" all screens which are not in the
    global screen list.

    Stop restarting on RandR changes
    
    This commit adds a "removed" signal to screens. Together with the "added" signal
    that we have since a while, this allows the C code to update the list of
    available screens dynamically without needing to restart.
    
    So far, this code received only minimal testing. So far, I don't have a nice
    idea on how to easily test this...

    Switch to a more specific nvidia binary blob work-around
    
    We once had the problem that with the nvidia blob, the X11 server told us that
    "yes, I do support RandR; there is just a single big screen" even though there
    were multiple screens and they could be queried for via Xinerama. To work around
    this, we started to ignore RandR if it only provided information about a single
    screen.
    
    Our long-term goal is to stop restarting on RandR screen changes. Thus, even if
    only a single screen is defined during startup, we should still use RandR later
    when another screen is added. This means that we cannot just ignore RandR if it
    only mentions a single screen.
    
    This commit copies what GTK+ does: If there is an output named "default", then
    some compatibility layer is assumed and we ignore RandR.
    
    I have no way to test if this really does the right thing.

    Restructure the way screen_scan() works
    
    Instead of adding all screens directly to globalconf.screens, the individual
    "scanner functions" now get a screen_array_t as their argument and add the
    screens there. Also, they no longer emit the "added" signal themselves (through
    screen_add()), but the caller does now does this instead once all screens are
    found.
    
    This commit drops the "deduplication" of screens. This likely means that clone
    mode causes duplicate screens. This will have to be re-added later.

    menubar.utils.parse_dir: Ask Gio for file type
    
    When not including standard::type in the query for children of a file then Gio
    may not look up this information. This might work on some file systems (e.g.
    ext4), but other (apparently XFS) do not provide the needed file type
    information (see man readdir on the d_type field). The result was that the
    menubar contained no entries because no .desktop files were identified as
    regular files and thus read.
    
    Fix this by including standard::type in the queries.
    
    Also, this commit makes the code use some pre-defined string constants from Gio
    to make "double sure" that typos are caught.
    
    Thanks to @Jajauma for doing the hard part on debugging this.

    awful.mouse: Add a generic mousegrabber
    
    Previously, all layouts had their own mouse grabbing logic. The
    new one is based on the client request::geometry feature.

    xresources theme: Use a RecordingSurface for wallpaper
    
    This theme draws a minimal wallpaper directly. This commit replaces the
    ImageSurface of the wallpaper with a RecordingSurface. This shouldn't have any
    visible effect, except for reducing memory usage, because an ImageSurface needs
    a lot of memory and is only eventually released by the garbage collector. A
    RecordingSurface instead just records the operations that were done which needs
    a lot less memory for the simple operations done here.

    Fix awful.screen.getbycoord when no screens exist
    
    When there are no screens, screen[1] causes an error. Thus, this isn't a safe
    fallback for these functions. Instead, this commit makes the code prefer the
    primary screen, if possible. If no screen exists, then screen.primary will be
    nil, but at least it won't throw an error like screen[1] does.
    
    (This also changes the outdated copy of getbycoord that exists in

    Fix integer overflow in overflow checking functions (#851)
    
    The min/max arguments to the integer range checking functions are integer. We
    call these with UINT32_MAX in two places and this value (notice the "U" for
    "unsigned") does not fit into a signed integer. Hence, there is an integer
    overflow at compile time and the maximum value that is actually checked for is
    -1.
    
    Fix this by using lua_Number (double) instead of int.

    geometry: Use the relevant rounding functions instead of integers
    
    In the case where one want to put the cursor at the middle of the
    workarea, it is logic to do:
    
       x=screen.workarea.x+screen.workasrea.width/2
    
    However, this can cause floating points. This commit move the
    burden back to the C-API so the Lua placement code doesn't have
    to add a large number of rounding methods. Given 1 type of rounding
    cover a vast majority of use cases for each types of coordinates,
    the C-API can take care of it in peace. For the other corner cases,
    it is still possible for the Lua code to do the rounding there, but
    no longer necessary. The convenstions are:
    
     'x' and 'y': use round (move to the closest point)
    
     'width' and 'height': use ceil (to avoid involontary truncating)

    screen: detect monitor configuration change
    
    Xorg server from git[1] generates ConfigNotify event when monitor
    configuration changes.
    
    We handle the event, but only trigger required awesome_restart() if
    screen size is changed. It's not what happens in case of monitor
    configuration change.
    
    Let's relax the condition and call awesome_restart() in response to all
    ConfigNotify events to root window.
    
    I'm not entirely sure that it wouldn't lead to superfluous restarts, but
    I don't see an option.

    screen: XRandR 1.5 support
    
    XRandR 1.5 adds support for the new monitor objects.
    
    'Monitor' is a rectangular subset of the screen which represents a
    coherent collection of pixels presented to the user. Each Monitor is be
    associated with a list of outputs (which may be empty).
    
    The patch below matches 1:1 screens in AwesomeWM with XRandR's Monitors.
    This way I get one screen across my 4K monitor, which is represented by
    two CRTCs.

    Default config: Use strings for tag names
    
    Tag names really are strings. Numbers just work accidentally since the C code
    uses luaL_checklstring() to access the tag name and this function silently
    converts numbers to strings.
    
    This also has a nice documentation effect, making it easier for people to figure
    out that they can change the name of a tag. Plus, with this the changes done by
    previous commits make more sense (specifying an awful.rules-rule that identifies
    a tag by name).

    ldoc doesn't allow to specify fields from class "A" into class "B",

    Also, one of the most common complain on IRC since Awesome 3.0 is

    Also restore the `awful.client` doc link, point to `client`

    documentation: Add various tags and fix section order.
    
    Previously, the `Signals` section was shown before the `Functions`.
    This was confusing and different from other framework documentation.
    
    It partially work. Not all ldoc output display the functions at the
    top, but some does. Previously, none did.
    
    This commit also add 3 new sections:
    
     * property: For object properties, replacing the "fields" table
       from the current documentations.
     * deprecated: For deprecated methods
     * beautiful: For widgets theme options

    Update root window size on RandR notify
    
    The code that claims to do what XRRUpdateConfiguration() would do was actually
    wrong. That function does not send any requests to the X11 server, but it just
    updates the local, in-memory state.
    
    This commit makes us do the same: We update the size of the root window if it
    changed. The code is directly inspired from the code in libXrandr.

    Update root window size on ConfigureNotify
    
    This commit copies part of what XRRUpdateConfiguration() would do. When the root
    window is resized, we update the information that the X11 server sent to us when
    we connected to it to contain the new size of the root window.
    
    This is 50% ugly, but having our own copy of the root window size would be 51%
    ugly, so it's better to write to the XCB-owned structure.
    
    Right now this is all dead code anyway, because we restart anyway, but since the
    goal is to get rid of that restart, this is a step in the right direction (e.g.
    root.size() will automatically return the new size).

    Clean up static variables in event_handle
    
    This function needs the event numbers for events from some extensions. These are
    assigned dynamically by the server. Right now, this is done by having a bunch of
    static variables that are initialized when needed.
    
    Refactor this to have a function event_init() instead that sets variable in
    globalconf (where all of our state should be saved). Also, a preprocessor macro
    is introduced to handle event dispatch which also looks a bit nicer.

    gears.screen: Merge into awful.screen
    
    gears modules usually don't depend on Awesome C-API. This code has
    been placed there for unclear reasons.
    
    Also, there is ongoing work to unify each "concepts" API into one
    single page. Having `gears.screen` go against this effort.

    Revert "Only define screens after the config is loaded"
    
    This reverts commit e6037b47385bb908e56ee8aaf32097b971790c38. It causes many
    issues with non-trivial solutions that we first need to come up with. As a
    middle ground, we will for now only emit signals if something changes after the
    config is loaded.

    Keep the cairo surface we use for setting the wallpaper
    
    This fixes a race where we would keep giving the old wallpaper surface to Lua
    when a new one was set, because we didn't get the "wallpaper changed"-event yet.
    Fix this by just keeping the surface we use for setting the wallpaper around.

    Fix invalid memory usage in event.c
    
    p_dup really only duplicates the given region of memory. It does not append a
    zero byte. Thus, the string we are using here was not zero-terminated.
    
    Fix this by just using lua_pushlstring() so that we do not have to worry about a
    null terminating the string at all.

    Only define screens after the config is loaded
    
    This gives us the worst of both worlds: We still restart on RandR screen changes
    and the information about screens isn't available during startup. However, it's
    a step in the right direction, because all Lua code will now have to handle
    kind-of-dynamic screen changes.

    This adds gears.screen which contains a wrapper around
    screen.connect_signal("added", func) that also calls the callback function for
    each screen that already exists. This is added in gears.screen so that it can
    also be used from e.g. wibox, if needed. Feel free to move this elsewhere if
    that's a bad idea (I'm not really convinced of it).

    C-API: Return screen objects instead of indicies
    
    This commit makes all C code that previously returned a screen index now return
    a screen object, continuing the deprecation of screen indicies. Note that this
    is an API break and will likely cause all kinds of problems for users.
    
    The change also breaks some tests which are suitably fixed in this commit.

    invalid UTF8 should be send out. Mine doesn't. Also, our behaviour of replacing
    non-strings silently with strings is weird.
    
    This commit thus makes converting from Lua to dbus fail if a non-string should
    be sent as a string or if a string contains malformed UTF8.

    Fix error handling in the keygrabber
    
    We called the keygrabber and told Lua we are expecting one return value, so Lua
    will always get us one return value on the Lua stack. However, when an error
    happens, nothing is pushed on the stack, but we still tried to pop the return
    value. This corrupted the Lua stack.
    
    The easiest fix is to just not ask for a return value that is not used anyway.
    
    Not adding a test for this, because the test has to cause a Lua error which the
    C code will then log to stderr and the test runner considers this a test
    failure...

    Make tests more reliable on "early errors"
    
    When e.g. test-leaks.lua fails, it will cause a Lua error before starting the
    test runner. This means that the test will just hang, because nothing causes
    awesome to quit.
    
    Handle this by starting a timer when the test runner is loaded and quitting
    awesome in there if no test run was started yet. This only works if all tests
    load the runner before doing anything that could fail, so the require("_runner")
    is moved to the beginning in every test.

    - horizontal and vertical reflection were mixed up (I guess it has always been

    gears.surface: Change the way that caching works
    
    Loading a file normally has the same behaviour as before. First the cache is
    checked and if nothing is found, the file is loaded and cached.
    
    This commit changes the behaviour of loading a file uncached. This no longer
    removes the file from the cache if it is cached (why should it?) and also does
    not put it in the cache.
    
    This means that users of load_uncached and load_uncached_silently can now freely
    modify the resulting surface without interfering with other API users.

    Add and use luaA_pushscreen()
    
    Even when a screen is just an integer, the code becomes a bit more
    self-documenting. Even better, if we start to handle screen objects to Lua
    instead of screen indicies, there will only be one place that needs to be
    changed.

    Update transient_for when a new window appears
    
    When we manage the transient before the main window, the client object's
    .transient_for property would stay nil. This happens because the property points
    to a window which we don't know (yet) and thus is ignored.
    
    Fix this by remembering the value of WM_TRANSIENT_FOR and checking in
    client_manage() if the new client is the "missing window we did not find
    before".

    Check that the Lua stack is empty in the main loop
    
    The Lua stack is a finite resource and everything that pushes something there
    should also clean up. This is not a problem for functions that are called by
    Lua, because their "stack frame" is freed when they return. However, in global
    context, Lua does not and cannot automatically clean up for us. Thus, it makes
    sense to print a warning in this case.

    Don't modify WM_HINTS in client_set_urgent()
    
    To quote from ICCCM (§4.1.2): "The window manager will not change properties
    written by the client."
    
    We tried to do this anyway to update WM_HINTS so that the current urgency state
    is reflected. Apparently, Chrome does a similar read-modify-set cycle and the
    resulting race condition meant that the "accepts input" hint on Chromium's
    window was permanently disabled.
    
    This helps with https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/670, but I still
    think that Chrome shouldn't try to implement "please don't focus me when I do
    the following" by temporarily claiming "please don't ever focus me".

    Fix test-urgent.lua
    
    Step 1 starts a client and uses awful.rules to move it to a not-selected tag.
    Because this rule still has focus=true, this calls awful.ewmh.activate() via the
    request::activate signal. This function makes the client urgent because it is on
    a not-selected tag.
    
    Step 3 does the same thing, but also uses switchtotag=true. Now
    awful.ewmh.activate() doesn't make the client urgent because it successfully
    focused this client. However, the test was wrongly assuming that the client
    became urgent (copy&paste error? I don't know).
    
    The fix is of course not to require the client to become urgent.

    Fix awful.ewmh to handle window gravities
    
    Since commit b2aaefd095c964491f2c93a, we correctly handle window gravities when
    the border width of a client changes. Since most windows out there have a
    NorthWest gravity, this means that most windows do not have this problem.
    However, e.g. mplayer uses gravity "Static" and this causes this issue (any
    gravity other than NorthWest will do).
    
    This affects the fullscreen handling in awful.ewmh. The code has to set the
    border width before it changes a client's geometry so that the move when the
    border width changes doesn't matter.
    
    No new integration test for this since I didn't find anything usable with a
    non-NorthWest gravity. A test would be easy to write, just test if `c.fullscreen
    = true ; c.fullscreen = false` restores the previous window geometry.

    much.
    
    When someone wants to still use this, they are free to copy this to their own

    Fix test-leak-client.lua under LuaCov
    
    Both the test runner and the wibox use gears.timer.delayed_call(). The test
    runner uses this to call steps and the wibox uses it to trigger redraws. When
    running under LuaCov, the Lua code becomes slow enough that the wibox didn't
    redraw yet when the leak check is run. This causes the check to fail, because
    the client is still referenced by the tasklist and thus cannot be garbage
    collected.

    Finally, Qt handle this using the QBrush concept, where you can have
    programmatic patterns. Cairo doesn't have this concept, so there is no
    "clean" way to have programmatic brushes.

    awful.titlebar: Fix memory leak with clients
    
    Any awful.titlebar.widget.button widget (e.g. floatingbutton or closebutton)
    decides on the currently visible symbol based on several factors. One of them is
    "is the client currently focused?" and thus the button has to be updated when
    the client is focused/unfocused.
    
    The way the code did this was to use client.connect_signal("focus", f) and
    client.connect_signal("unfocus", f). However, these signals are never
    disconnected and kept alive forever. The callback function had a strong
    reference to the client (as an upvalue) and thus this also prevented the client
    from being garbage collected.
    
    Fix this by using c:connect_signal("focus/unfocis", f) instead. These kind of
    signals are only kept alive by the client object and don't prevent it from being
    garbage collected.
    
    This fixes the new test that the previous commit added.

    layout.fixed: Add methods to manipulate the layout after creation
    
    Until now, this layout was "append only". There was no official
    APIs to remove, replace, insert and swap widgets. This is fine
    for the usual wibox + sensors widget used by the majority of
    users, but lack flexibility necessary to use the layout system
    to place dynamic elements such as clients.
    
    The methods introduced by this commit are also recursive. This
    allow widgets to be decorated, wrapped and splitted without
    having to add boilerplate code everywhere.

    Move handling of MappingNotify to xkb.c
    
    A quote from the XKeyboard specification:
    
      The server notifies interested clients of keyboard map changes in one of two
      ways. It sends XkbMapNotify to clients that have explicitly selected them and
      core protocol MappingNotify events to clients that have not. Once a client
      requests XkbMapNotify events, the server stops sending it MappingNotify events
      to inform it of keyboard changes.
    
    This commit moves the code that we had for handling MappingNotify events to the
    place where we handle XkbMapNotify events. This might even fix some bugs where
    parts of awesome continued to use old key binding "stuff"!

    Make benchmarks less exact
    
    The benchmarks in tests/test-benchmark.lua have two modes. When CI=1 is set in
    the environment, only a "quick" and less exact test is done. Otherwise, a slower
    and more exact measurements is taken. This was added so that we do not waste CPU
    time on travis.
    
    However, most of the time the user running "make check" doesn't want exact
    measurements either. So instead of only being quick when CI=1 is set, this
    commit changes the logic to always being quick unless BENCHMARK_EXACT=1 is set.
    Additionally, a message is printed next to the benchmark results so that the
    user is reminded to set this var if the measurements should actually mean
    something.

    client: Add swapped, raised and lowered signals
    
    This allow layout "arrange" to be called less often and react on
    the cause of the change itself rather than it's consequences
    (usually, the "focus" signal).
    
    Previously, the layout were re-arranged everytime the focus changed.
    Now, with "raised" and "lowered", it require less "arrange".
    
    "swapped" allow smarted layouts. Currently, swapped cause a full
    re-arrange. It re-read the "index" list from scratch and create
    a "new" layout. With "swapped", incremental layout changes are
    possible.

    test/run.sh: Handle updated beauitful.init call in default config
    
    While setting up an environment to run the integration tests in, the run.sh
    script uses sed to generate versions of several files that refer to the
    not-installed version of files. One of these needs to replace the call to
    beautiful.init().
    
    Before commit 20c9723c5b1645, the corresponding line was:
    
      beautiful.init("@AWESOME_THEMES_PATH@/default/theme.lua")
    
    Now this wants to find and replace the following:
    
      beautiful.init(awful.util.get_themes_dir() .. "default/theme.lua")
    
    To handle both versions, this commit adds some wildcards to the sed-expression
    so that any line containing a call to beautiful.init is found and replaced.

    Unmap the systray immediately when it becomes empty
    
    The new widget layout code was created because we needed to support partial
    redraws (only redraw the parts that were changed). Thanks to this, the code also
    skips drawing widgets of size 0x0. Thus, when the systray becomes empty, it's
    :draw() callback isn't invoked and thus our systray container window stays
    visible.
    
    Fix this by making the C code unconditionally hide the systray when it becomes
    empty. There's nothing to display anyway.

    Leave titlebars early
    
    When a client is unmanaged, we know emit mouse::leave on its titlebar before the
    client object is invalidated, so that Lua can still work with it. Before, this
    event was emitted only when we got a LeaveNotify from the X11 server.

    Fix icons
    
    Since commit ea94f7f7e64fd2b, the code has a preferred icon size and it tries to
    find the closest matching icon. However, the default size of 0 and thus this
    never returned any icon at all (no icon matches better than an icon of size
    0x0).

    Select button press/release events on drawins
    
    Some words about X11 event handling: Every X11 client can select input on any
    window. For this, inside the X11 server each window has for each client a
    bitmask for the kind of events that this client is interested in. When a mouse
    button is pressed inside of a window, a corresponding event is generated for
    that window and sent to all X11 clients which asked for
    XCB_EVENT_MASK_BUTTON_PRESS. When no client is interested in this event, the
    event is propagated to the parent window and the same procedure is done again
    here. This continues up until the root window is reached.
    
    Some words about the event masks that awesome uses: For clients, we ask for
    button press events on the frame window that we reparent the client window into
    so that we get any kind of press on the titlebar (and also events inside of the
    client window if the client itself doesn't care for click events?). We are also
    interested in button presses / releases on the root window. However, before this
    commit, we didn't actually ask for button events on drawins (e.g. the wibox).
    This worked fine, because no one asked for these events and the event propagated
    to the root window where it was then sent to awesome.
    
    However, newer Qt versions do something weird and the above broke. I don't
    actually know what is going on. I know about the above propagation rules, but
    looking at protocol traces of what Qt does, awesome should still get the button
    events. During startup, Qt asks for button events on its own windows. After a
    hotplug event, it asks the same again, but now also includes the root window.
    So... how can Qt asking for button events on the root window cause awesome not
    to get them? I have no idea.
    
    (And yes, I guess that Qt asking for mouse events on the root window is a bug,
    but I have no idea how exactly this happens nor about any other side effects of
    it).
    
    This commit makes us ask for button events on our drawins so that the server
    will send them to us. This is the right thing to do anyway and it was reported
    to have some positive effects.

    gears.object:weak_connect_signal: Use a weak-value table (#520)
    
    Lua will remove objects as values from a weak table before these objects are
    finalized, but as values only in the next garbage collection cycle after the
    object was finalized. Up to now, gears.object uses a table with weak keys so
    that :disconnect_signal() works. This means that a signal can still call methods
    which were already considered garbage by the garbage collector and thus can use
    userdata from the C side which was already finalized. Crashes and other bugs
    result.
    
    This commit changes the code so that the function is also a value in the weak
    table. Thus, the GC will remove the entry before the object is finalized.
    
    Special magic is needed for Lua 5.1, because there only userdata has the
    behavior that we want while we have a function. We do some magic with function
    environments to make this work...

    Add a test case capturing problems with weak_connect_signal (#520)
    
    This adds a cyclic dependency between the function used for the weak signal and
    an object with a __gc metamethod. The problem occurs since the GC will first
    finalize the object (call its __gc metamethod) and only in the next generation
    will it actually collect the garbage and remove the functions from weak-tables
    using it as a key.
    
    And yes this needs special code for Lua 5.1 because there __gc doesn't work on
    tables. :-(

    wibox.widget.systray: Also emit redraw_needed
    
    When emitting layout_changed, the widget is relayouted. If this doesn't actually
    change anything, nothing will be redrawn. Thus, this also emits redraw_needed to
    force redraws.
    
    This fixes a race condition with some weird tray icons. A new tray icon is
    created and the systray is updated. Then this new icon is destroyed immediately
    again and at the same time another icon is created. Then, the systray isn't
    updated since the number of icons (=the layout) did not actually change.
    However, it needs to be updated and so we ended up with broken/missing icons.

    awful.spawn.with_line_callback: Add exit callback
    
    This adds support for the callback that was added in the previous commit to this

    awesome.spawn: Add exit status support
    
    This adds a new argument to awesome.spawn. This argument is a function that will
    be called with the exit status once the spawned process terminates. For normal
    exit, the function is called with "exit" and the exit code. If the process is
    terminated by a signal, the function will be called with "signal" and the signal
    number of the signal that caused termination.

    The only exception is the window for _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK. That window

    Enable detectable autorepeat (#550)
    
    Imagine the following snippet is run:
    
        keygrabber.run(function(mod, key, event)
          gears.debug.dump{mod, key, event}
        end)
    
    The above starts a keygrabber and prints the events that are received.
    Currently, when a key is pressed and held down, this prints a series of press
    and release, because that's what the X11 server sends us.
    
    This commit enables detectable autorepeat. This means that the X11 server only
    sends us a series of press events for autorepeat and a single release when the
    key really is released.
    
    Testing this is a bit hard, because detectable autorepeat does not seem to work
    with Xephyr. Instead, a "real" Xorg instance is needed.
    
    We do not check the response to the PerClientFlags request, because it doesn't
    really tell us anything useful. If the server does not support detectable
    autorepeat, we could print a warning, but so what? As I just said, this does not
    work in Xephyr and yet Xephyr announced to support this.

    Add failing test: c.startup_id should be nil when snid is disabled
    
    When using `spawn` without startup notification support, the
    `startup_id` property on the client should be nil.
    
    This adds rxvt-unicode to the Travis build, because it supports startup
    notifications, but xterm does not.  We should replace xterm with it in
    the existing tests then later.

    Spawn: Improve handling of startup notification
    
    The ID for startup notification is transmitted to the spawned process via the
    DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment variable. Before this commit, we set this
    variable in the main process. This meant that if we started something "without"
    a startup id, then it might get the ID that was used by the last spawn and which
    was still saved in our env. Fix this by setting the environment variable only
    after fork().
    
    Small anecdote: The above wasn't enough to make Daniel's test case succeed and
    at first I couldn't figure out why.
    
    Turns out that rxvt-unicode doesn't unset the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment
    variable (I think it should, according to some spec), even though it supports
    startup notification. So awesome was already started with DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID set
    and thus all spawned processes used this ID.
    
    Fix this by explicitly unsetting DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID if we don't set any new
    value (even though this breaks encapsulation; we shouldn't have to care about
    this "implementation detail" of libstartup-notification).

    Set the wallpaper more intelligently
    
    Usually users want a wallpaper on all their screens. With the current code, this
    resulted in a loop of upload-wallpaper, {download-wallpaper, add-new-part,
    upload-wallpaper}*.
    
    Fix this by being more intelligent: Instead of setting the wallpaper
    immediately, this now uses gears.timer.delayed_call() to set the wallpaper. All
    following modifications which come in before the delayed call runs will still be
    part of the current update. This should mean that during startup, there is just
    a single upload of a wallpaper.
    
    (The above is what happens if there is no wallpaper yet. If there is already
    one, we use :create_similar() and thus should only upload the part of the
    wallpaper that changed, but this doesn't really make a difference.)
    
    As a side-effect, the new code no longer draws to the old wallpaper to modify
    it, but always creates a copy of it. This means that:

    Thanks to the way that X11 works, geometries consider the size of the client

    text is cut off and afterwards it is shown completely:
    
      naughty.notify({
          text = string.rep("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n", 4),
          width = 75
      })

    Textbox: Add API for queriying preferred size (#466)
    
    This adds :get_preferred_size() and :get_preferred_size_at_dpi() which return
    the size (=width, height) that the textbox would need if unlimited space is
    available.
    
    This also adds :get_height_for_width() and :get_height_for_width_at_dpi() which
    return the height that the textbox would need if the given width is available.

    Grab client keys on the client window (#496)
    
    Before this, we grabbed the keys on the frame window. That meant we only got key
    events for things that nothing else grabbed directly on the key window.
    
    After this, we grab directly on the client window itself and so we "fight" with
    everything else which wants to grab keys. I don't actually know how the winner
    is decided... First come, first serve, the rest gets an error?

    Remember mouse position per screen
    
    The mouse position is saved and restored when focusing another screen
    
    If the target screen has no saved mouse position, the relative position
    of the current screen is used

    imagebox: Redraw in :set_image()
    
    If someone modifies a cairo surface and then sets the resulting object as the
    image of an imagebox, the imagebox needs to redraw. Thus, since surfaces are
    modifiable, we cannot assume that nothing changed when the same image is set
    multiple times on an imagebox.
    
    However, the dimensions of a surface cannot be changed and thus this does not
    need to emit widget::layout_changed.

    Never explicitly focus the root window
    
    Whenever client.focus == nil, we set the input focus to the root window to
    express "nothing has the input focus". However, thanks to the way X11 input
    works, this means that whatever is under the mouse cursor gets keyboard input
    events. This can easily be reproduced with urxvt and some small addition to the
    config to unfocus things.
    
    This commit changes things. Instead of focusing the root window, we create a
    special "no focus" window that gets focused if we want nothing to have the
    focus.

    test-leaks: Fix with Lua 5.1
    
    I have no idea why this needs collectgarbage() to be called twice.
    
    On the other hand, I can explain the change in tooltip.lua. Lua 5.2 introduced
    "ephermeron tables". This means that in the following sitation, lua 5.2 can
    collect the entry from the table, while 5.1 keeps the entry alive, because the
    table has a strong reference to the value and that in turn has a strong
    reference to the key:
    
      t = setmetatable({}, { __mode = "k"})
      do
        local k = {}
        t[k] = function() print(k) end
      end
      collectgarbage("collect")
      print(next(t, nil))
    
    To handle this incompatibility, this commit just removes the whole indirection
    through the module-level variable "data".

    Don't measure time for creating wiboxes
    
    Apparently some of the last commits speeds up create_wibox() a lot. This
    highlights that this is a bad test: After creating thousands of wiboxes, awesome
    needed 15 seconds to draw all of them and in the end some dbus timeout aborted
    the test run.
    
    However, it's irrelevant how quickly we can create wibox. The interesting number
    is how quickly we can display a new wibox. Thus, this commits changes the code
    so that it also measures the time that is needed to update the wibox. This way,
    we don't accumulate a huge number of pending repaints and everything's fine.
    
    Some results (but there is nothing to compare this with):
       create&draw wibox: 0.0373947  sec/iter ( 28 iters, 1.59 sec for benchmark)
        update textclock: 0.00198174 sec/iter (515 iters, 1.937 sec for benchmark)
      relayout textclock: 0.000614439 sec/iter (1710 iters, 1.051 sec for benchmark)
        redraw textclock: 0.00116882 sec/iter (865 iters, 2.962 sec for benchmark)

    Make layoutbox kind-of garbage-collectable
    
    Instead of connecting to the needed tag-update-signal again for every layoutbox,
    this now just creates a single connection and updates all layoutboxes from here.
    A new weak table is used to find the layoutboxes from these callbacks.
    Additionally, layoutboxes are now per-screen unique. So even if you try to
    create three layoutboxes for screen 1, the code will now always return the same
    instance.
    
    This kind-of fixes the leak test for layoutboxes. The problem is that the
    default config also creates a layoutbox and adds it to a wibox. Since this is
    now the same layoutbox, the test still fails. Just removing the layoutbox-part
    from the default config makes this problem go away.

    Make textclock garbage-collectable
    
    This fixes the textclock-specific part of the test that the previous commit
    added.
    
    To fix this, gears.timer.weak_start_new() is used. This function creates a timer
    that is automatically stopped when its callback function is garbage collected.
    The callback function is saved as a member of the texbox widget that is the
    "widget behind the textclock". Thus, the timer can only be stopped after the
    widget is garbage-collected, but the timer does not keep the widget alive.

    Enhance menubar icon path lookup
    
    The way of icon path lookup for `menubar` is enhanced so that it is
    based on a theme-oriented way as described in the specification:
    
      Icon Theme Specification, Ver. 0.12
      http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html
    
    To accomplish this:
    
     * Add the two new files `icon_theme.lua` and `index_theme.lua`.
    
       The former implements an icon lookup algorithm suggested in the URL
       above.  The latter implements a helper object to parse the cache file
       `index.theme` of which data is used by the former.
    
     * Modify `menu_gen.lua` to use the new algorithm.
    
       - The implementation of `lookup_category_icons` is changed
         accordingly.
       - The values of the field `all_categories.icon_name` are changed file
         names to icon names, i.e., file extensions which are used to
         indicate image file formats are removed.
    
     * Add the new file `icon_theme_spec.lua` for a unit test for checking
       if `icon_theme.lua` together with `index_theme.lua` works as
       expected.

    Add and use wibox.hierarchy:update()
    
    This function updates a hierarchy if the layout of some widgets changed. It does
    nothing on the parts that did not change. This should be more efficient than
    recomputing the whole hierarchy whenever something changes.
    
    Once again, this has some positive results on the "benchmark test":
    
    Before:
            create wibox: 0.083016   sec/iter ( 13 iters, 1.161 sec for benchmark)
        update textclock: 0.00391091 sec/iter (271 iters, 3.219 sec for benchmark)
      relayout textclock: 0.00273234 sec/iter (397 iters, 1.087 sec for benchmark)
        redraw textclock: 0.0010191  sec/iter (989 iters, 1.745 sec for benchmark)
    
    After:
            create wibox: 0.083146   sec/iter ( 13 iters, 1.163 sec for benchmark)
        update textclock: 0.00170519 sec/iter (647 iters, 2.201 sec for benchmark)
      relayout textclock: 0.000581637 sec/iter (1880 iters, 1.094 sec for benchmark)
        redraw textclock: 0.0010167  sec/iter (997 iters, 1.773 sec for benchmark)
    
    So again no difference for creating wiboxes (100.16% compared to before). This
    time we also have no real difference for creating wiboxes (99.76%). Update (44%)
    and relayout (21%) are improved a lot.

    Add a benchmark to the test suite
    
    This (ab)uses the integration tests to run a benchmark. This currently only
    measures wibox drawing performance. To avoid wasting CPU-cycles, this does only
    a quick run under travis while on "normal" runs the function under test is
    executed in a loop to improve the precision of the measurement.
    
    This benchmarks hopefully allow to optimize things in a clear fashion instead of
    things like "it feels faster to me".

    Modify CFLAGS handling
    
     - Remove `-rdynamic` from "CFLAGS" and count on CMake to pass it to
       the compiler at the link phase (Issue #450).
     - Move the definition of "CFLAGS" from `awesomeConfig.cmake` to
       `CMakeLists.txt` and give it a name, `AWESOME_C_FLAGS`, so that the
       relation between the target and the flags is made clearer and
       manageable.
     - Make `AWESOME_C_FLAGS` a cached variable so that the developers can
       tweak the flags promptly in accordance with their necessities without
       changing the prescribed value.
     - Add a logic to cope with the case where CMake fails to set
       `-rdynamic`.

    Handle enter/leave events with detail=Inferior correctly
    
    There is a client window C. Around this window, awesome adds a frame window F.
    When the pointer is inside of C and then moves inside of F, we get a LeaveNotify
    with detail=Inferior, but from our point of view, the pointer is still inside of
    C, because F is contained in C.
    
    Similarly, if the pointer is in F and moves to C, we get an EnterNotify with
    detail=Inferior that we should ignore. However, for an EnterNotify the pointer
    can now be inside of a titlebar, so this case has to be handled now.
    
    The above explains the enter/leave behavior for clients. Let's now think about
    titlebars: When the pointer moves from C to F, it cannot be in any titlebar any
    more, so we must generate a leave event on that titlebar. Similar when the
    pointer moves from F to C, but in this case we also have to figure out which
    titlebar now contains the pointer.
    
    This patch makes the code handle these events with detail=Inferior correctly.

    Fix enter/leave events on titlebars
    
    This adds a global variable that tracks the drawable that is currently under the
    mouse cursor. This new variable is then used so that we get consistent behavior
    for enter/leave signals. Such signals are now also generated when a MotionNotify
    event tells us that the pointer is now in a different titlebar.
    
    Before this, it was possible that we did not generate a leave event on a
    titlebar since the LeaveNotify contains the cursor position after the leave and
    we did not manage to figure out which titlebar was left.

    Explicitly track dependencies between widgets
    
    Before this, dependencies between widgets where implicitly discovered by
    recursive calls to base.fit_widget() and base.layout_widget(). However, it is
    too easy to get this wrong (just call one of these functions from outside of a
    widget's :fit() / :layout() function) and the resulting mess would be hard to
    debug.
    
    Thus, this commit changes the API so that callers have to identify themselves
    and we can explicitly record the dependency between the widgets involved.
    
    This also fixes a bug where no dependencies were tracked for widgets after
    :set_visible(false). Whoops...
    
    Sorry for breaking the API for adding this.

    wibox.drawable: Fix complete repaints
    
    When a complete repaint is scheduled, also do a relayout, because this is also
    the case that we go through when the underlying cairo surface is resized. For
    example, resizing a client with a titlebar would trigger this.
    
    Also, going through this code path is necessary since this is the only place
    where the dirty area is updated so that it includes "everything". Before this
    change, nothing was actually redrawn, because the dirty area was empty.

    Clearing caches is done by recording dependencies between a widget. When a call

    such a function, this means that the earlier widget depends on the later widget.
    This dependency is recorded and when the later widget emits

    Add a widget hierarchy implementation
    
    A widget hierarchy describes the position of widgets. The hierarchy is a

    :layout function that is not yet implemented on widgets, but will be added

    Add awful.util.spawn_with_line_callback
    
    This new function spawns a program, similarly to awful.spawn, but captures its
    output. On each line of output on stdout / stderr, a Lua function is called with
    this line. There are different callbacks for stdout and stderr. When both stdout
    and stderr are closed, another callback function is called. The intention for
    this last callback is "the program is done", because most programs should only
    close their output when they exit.

    > _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicates that the window should fill the

    wibox.layout.align: Correctly size second widget
    
    In expand nodes "none" and "outside", the variable size_remains describes how
    much space is available for the first/third widget. Everything else is used by
    the second widget. Thus, fitting the second widget to anything involving
    size_remains is wrong. Instead, this commit uses the correct value.
    
    This also fixes a messed up argument order for horizontal align layouts.

    tests/run.sh: Start Xvfb with -noreset
    
    When using Xephyr, this already starts the server with -noreset, but for Xvfb we
    also need this flag. Without this flag, the DPI value that is set via xrdb gets
    lost at server reset.
    
    This wasn't a problem before commit 6d4837a53abb. That commit moved the launch
    of the dbus session after the setting of the DPI. So previously, waiting for
    server startup was half broken (the dbus session already tried to connect to the
    server to check for when it shuts down), but due to this no server reset
    occurred and thus the DPI was correctly applied. After this commit, the server
    immediately resets after xrdb is done setting the DPI and the value set is lost.

    Move wibox.layout.rect_to_device_geometry to wibox.widget
    
    Having two modules named "base" is confusing and "wibox.layout" doesn't contain
    much useful stuff. This is a first step for removing wibox.layout by moving a
    function which should only ever be used internally in awesome.

    gears.timer: Add simpler ways to start timers
    
    This adds gears.timer.start(timeout, callback) that creates a timer object and
    connects a callback to it, all in one go.
    
    Additionally, this adds gears.timer.weak_start(timeout, callback). The weak
    version still allows the callback function to be garbage collected and will then
    stop the timer.
    
    This was tested with the following code:
    
      require("gears.timer").start(0.3, function()
        print("ping")
        if collectgarbage("step", 500) then
          print("collection done")
          error("err")
        end
        return true end)
      require("gears.timer").weak_start(0.1, function()
        io.stdout:write(".")
        return true
      end)
    
    After a full collection cycle, both timers are stopped. The first one is stopped
    because of the error() that it generated. The second one is stopped because the
    callback function was garbage collected.

    This factors out a function wait_until_success that runs some command until it

    Note that this removes the "kill -0" trick for early exit again and instead will
    use the timeout in case awesome dies during startup.

    awesome_atexit: keep client order always
    
    This is not only useful for soft restarts, but also when TERMinating
    awesome during development/testing.
    
    The drawback appears to be that it would leak a property on the root
    window in case it is really meant to be quit.

    Fix sporadic test failure due to lgi
    
    With version 2.0rc5, Busted started cleaning up between tests more thoroughly.
    The result was that it managed to unload and reload lgi. However, the C part of
    lgi is not safe to be reloaded. This caused sporadic errors in the test suite
    runs.
    
    Work around this via a helper script that is run before Busted starts running
    tests. When we load lgi in this helper script, it is loaded before Busted starts
    saving and restoring everything and thus lgi won't ever be unloaded.

    Preserve old mousegrabber behavior (additionally)
    
    18f6ab1 changed the behavior when resizing floating clients using the
    mouse (via modkey + RMB).
    
    Previously, you could initiate the mousegrabber using e.g. "modkey +
    RMB", release the key and button, and resize the window using the left
    mouse button.
    
    This restores this behavior by canceling the mousegrabbers only if the
    cursor was moved, without _any_ mouse button being pressed.

    Keep client order across restarts
    
    This saves the order of clients in a property called AWESOME_CLIENT_ORDER on the
    root window during shutdown. During startup, after managing all existing
    windows, we force the client list into the order described by this property
    (overwriting any changes that Lua possibly did).
    
    This code should safely handle cases where the property doesn't contain all
    existing clients or contains a client which doesn't exist anymore.

    tests: Check if test file is readable before running it
    
    I tried calling this script with "tests/foo.lua" as an argument, but it actually
    expects "foo.lua" since it changes into the appropriate directory itself.
    Because this file does not exist, "cat $f | awesome-client" failed and thus this
    whole script just hung (the test runner was never actually started).
    
    Fix this by testing for the test-file to exist before trying to run it.

    Improved awesome-client: exit code, bash, prompt
    
     - exit with a non-zero status code when dbus-send fails.
       If awesome does not respond to the D-Bus message, e.g. because it is not
       running (yet), awesome-client now returns with a non-zero return code.
       This can be used to check if awesome has finished starting up, which is
       meant to be used for the functional test runner.
     - changed the shebang to use bash directly, which simplifies the logic
       to detect/handle "bash as /bin/sh" and allows to use `set -o pipefail`
       (which makes handling the D-Bus error easier - without using a subshell).
     - fix the prompt: now with trailing space, and the prompt is actually used
       (which wasn't the case with /bin/sh not pointing at bash before).
    
    Closes https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/pull/304.

    Replace color_strip_alpha with ensure_pango_color
    
    color_strip_alpha was used to insert colors into Pango markup, but it
    did not correctly check for valid Pango colors. ensure_pango_color
    checks if the color is valid in Pango, and returns a placeholder if it
    is not.

    Make sure "err" is a string in debug::error handler
    
    I've noticed that `Pango.parse_markup` returns "userdata" instead of a
    string in case of errors [1], which then causes the `debug::error`
    handler to not handle it correctly:
    
        W: awesome: luaA_dofunction:77: error while running function

    Mousegrabber: Correctly handle press/release events
    
    When you run a mousegrabber, the C code calls this callback when the pointer is
    moved or when a button is pressed/released. However, the button state is totally
    bogus on press/release events, always claiming that the button that was
    pressed/released is the only button that is pressed (even for release events!).
    
    This commit fixes up the code so that the button state after the press/release
    event is passed to the mousegrabber callback function.

    client.focus.byidx: handle raising in the function itself

    Use request::activate with raise=false instead

    autofocus: use request::focus instead of request::activate
    
    In #152 I've changed the autofocus handler to emit the request::activate
    signal, instead of setting client.focus only.
    
    This is wrong IMHO, and can be annoying:
    
    If you have two floating clients above a tiled / maximized one, and
    close one of the floating ones, with the tiled one being the one
    selected by autofocus, it will be raised above the other floating
    client.
    
    This is changed now to use the new `request::focus` signal instead.
    
    This basically reverts 20cdb5d (#152), but allows for customizing this
    behavior, by overriding the default `request::focus` handler
    (`ewmh.focus`).
    
    It would be nice if there was a helper to check if a window's content
    isn't visible at all (i.e. covered by other windows), and that could be
    used then by the (new) default handler for request::focus - raising the
    client only, if it's completely covered by another window.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/217

    Add request::focus signal, with ewmh.focus being the default handler
    
    This still does `client.focus = c` by default, but allows to customize
    it.
    
    This was initially suggested in #194, but by using `request::activate`
    instead, which would not be the same.  Therefore a new signal is being
    used instead.

    Use :weak_connect_signal() for connecting to widget::updated
    
    This way "that other widget" doesn't prevent the current widget from being
    garbage collected.
    
    Please note that this in all of these cases the widget under consideration does
    have a strong reference to the callback function. This means that the callback
    cannot be garbage collected until "this widget" itself is collected. Thanks to
    this, this change is safe.

    Connecting to a signal weakly has the same effect as connecting to it strongly,

    default config: raise with "maximize" and "fullscreen"
    
    After using sloppy mouse focus to select a client (which does not raise
    it already), maximizing/fullscreening it should then raise it.
    
    This also uses the new shortcut `c.maximized = not c.maximized`.

    Make stdout/stderr line buffered
    
    This improves the behaviour with print()ing for debugging, when the
    output is redirected to a file.
    
    I was using `setbuf(…, 0)` initially, but it makes sense to buffer it
    per line.  This uses `setvbuf` instead of `setlinebuf`, which might not
    be available everywhere.

    Unset object's metatable in __gc
    
    Run the following code:
    
      do
          local d
          local f = function() d.visible = true end
          if _VERSION >= "Lua 5.2" then
              setmetatable({}, { __gc = f })
          else
              getmetatable(newproxy(true)).__gc = f
          end
          d = drawin({})
      end
      collectgarbage("collect")
    
    Awesome will segfault.
    
    The reason for this is that after the above code ran, all variables in it are
    unreferenced and will be garbage-collected at the next sweep phase. Lua runs
    garbage collectors in the inverse order that their corresponding objects were
    "marked" which means for the above code that the drawin's garbage collector will
    run before function f runs. So the code will access the drawin after its
    destructor already ran. Obviously, awesome's C code does not expect nor
    correctly deal with this situation and was dereferencing a NULL pointer.
    
    To fix this, this commit "unsets" the metatable of a userdata object when it is
    being garbage collected. Since the type of a userdata is inferred via its
    metatable, the object will no longer be accepted by luaA_toudata().
    
    For the above code this will result in an unhelpful error message saying that
    something tried to index a userdata, but userdata cannot be indexed. At least we
    no longer crash and the traceback of the error will hopefully point at some __gc
    metamethod which should be enough of a hint to figure out the problem.

    awful.layout.inc: Hide API breakage
    
    In commit 3cbdc2a79ff72, the argument order for awful.layout.inc was changed
    from (layouts, i, s) to (i, s, layouts), so that layouts can become an optional
    parameter. However, this change (obviously) breaks user configs.
    
    To hide this breakage, we assume the old argument order if the number i is a
    table. This cannot break anything, since the operator "+" will error out on
    tables anyway. :-)

    autofocus: use focus.filter, via new arg to focus.history.get
    
    This adds an optional `filter` arg to awful.client.focus.history.get,
    and uses `awful.client.focus.filter` from the autofocus module.
    
    This improves the behaviour when manually setting clients as
    non-focusable (#237), and is considered to be the desired behaviour in
    general.
    
    Closes https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/pull/242.

    Make client.focusable writable from Lua
    
    It uses an extra boolean to track if `c.focusable` has been set.
    
    It's possible to unset the overriding by setting it to `nil`, i.e.
    `client.focus.focusable = nil`.

    When moving a fullscreen/maximized client to a smaller screen or with
    different Y offset etc, its offset was not handled properly.
    
    This moves it first into the new area, and then makes sure that its not
    off-screen.  The latter should not happen, because the width/height is
    adjusted before.

    Also, add a macro for the client type, which will simplify parameter
    definitions. With this we can write `@client` instead of `@tparam
    client` in order to denote that the parameter needs to be a client
    structure. This simplifies `awful.client` module.
    
    This also excludes some of the `.lua` files from generating the

    information or any public functions at all. This make the docs easier to

    Ignore more events while minimizing a client
    
    When minimizing a client, we temporarily ignore events for the client window (so
    that we don't get the UnmapNotify event that we are causing for the unmap) and
    for the root window (I don't actually know why, no "harmful" events should be
    caused...).
    
    However, we weren't ignoring events on the frame window itself. This commit
    fixes that oversight.
    
    The problem here is that the pointer could be inside the window that is being
    minimized. When we then unmap said window, the pointer will now be inside of the
    frame window and the X11 server will thus generate an EnterNotify. When we
    handle this event later on, we emit mouse::enter on the client and e.g. the
    default config then focuses this client, which undoes the minimization.
    
    This fixes a regression introduced in commit 3aeac3870ca4855 and fixes #92.

    autofocus: emit `request::activate` signal
    
    After a client gets unmanaged, the newly focused client might not be
    visible / raised above other windows.
    
    Using the `request::activate` signal makes the autofocus handler more
    flexible, and will raise the focused client by default.

    If a client's width/height is larger than the screen's geometry, align

        % gvim -u NONE -N --cmd "set lines=$((LINES + 5))"
    
    Without this patch the top of the window is off-screen, but the bottom
    should be.  Fixing it using a number of lines that fit the screen should
    display the window completely.

    Revert "awful.rules.execute: use delayed_call for emitting request::activate"
    
    The 'request::activate' signal should be sent and handled immediately,
    and not delayed.  It was too much of a hack to work around the client
    not being visible.
    
    Instead, the "is visible" constraint on `capi.client.focus` will be
    removed.

    Partly revert commit 90fde1393f
    
    That commit made awful.tag use timer.delayed_call() to call withcurrent() during
    the manage signal. The idea was "if nothing else assigns any tags until the end,
    apply some default ones".
    
    However, the C core refuses to set the input focus to an unviewable client and
    thus this means that setting the input focus during manage failed. So, instead
    of using the delayed_call(), just call withcurrent() directly, like we did
    before.
    
    However, some part of that commit is still left: Awful.rules no longer
    disconnects the withcurrent() callback from the "manage" signal. This was
    originally added in commit 5e7ddd1efa, because it clients flickered otherwise if
    they were moved to some unselected tag during "manage". This happened because
    the C code unbanned the client when it got assigned the input focus and only
    later did some other code move it to some unselected tag.
    
    However, this flickering will no longer occur, because commit 3dbf89c990 added
    lazy focus setting. Thanks to this, setting the focus no longer unbans a client
    as a side-effect. Thus, if you focus a client and then remove it from all
    selected tags, nothing will be visible on-screen.
    
    To make a long story short: This commit reverts the part of commit 90fde1393f
    which caused side effects. The part that wasn't necessary any more is left in.

    Add support for notification actions
    
    The desktop notification specification says that a notification can have
    different actions. These actions allow the user to interact with the client
    application and should be displayed by the notification server.
    * Add function to emit a DBus signal
    * Notifications : emit NotificationClosed signal when closing notification
    * Notifications: use constant for notification closed reasons
    * notifications: Implement notifications actions
    
    This is just a basic implementation to display the actions send with the
    notifications. The actions should be displayed differently
    * Notifications: add support for default action

    Implement icon_pixmap and icon_mask from WM_HINTS (FS#1297)
    
    Fun fact: ICCCM specifies that icon_pixmap must have depth 1. Xterm uses a
    pixmap with depth 24. Yay... As such, I don't have any test for the depth == 1
    case and will just assume that it does the right thing. If it doesn't, I bet no
    one will notice anyway.

    Hide globalconf.L
    
    Everything that needs the lua_State should create a local variable like this:
    
      lua_State *L = globalconf_get_lua_State();
    
    This ensures that the compiler warns if there are two variables with name "L" in
    scope. The idea here is that it should become harder to accidentally use the
    global lua state instead of the state of the current state.
    
    While writing this commit, I found another place that gets its wrong: Reading
    client.focus from a coroutine was broken, since it was returning the result on
    the main thread instead of the current one.

    tag_client: Add explicit lua_State argument
    
    tag_client() said that it refers to the tag ontop of the lua stack. However, it
    implicitly used globalconf.L as its stack. So if you tagged a client with a tag
    from a coroutine, thinks would Go Wrong (tm). Fix this by adding an explicit
    lua_State* argument.

    drawable/drawin: Pass both lua_State and stack index around
    
    A stack index without the corresponding lua_State pointer is useless, because it
    could reference another coroutine than the main thread and thus just assuming
    globalconf.L is wrong. Fix this by also passing around the corresponding
    lua_State pointer.
    
    This improves the result for the following test:
    
      coroutine.resume(coroutine.create(function()
          drawin({}).visible = true
      end))

    Don't move clients on ConfigureRequests (FS#1030)
    
    I never saw a single program that set a border on its own windows. However,
    awesome commonly sets borders on its clients and the position of a client is the
    part outside of the border. So when processing a position request from a client,
    we also have to include this border and fix things up correspondingly.
    
    However, the same isn't needed for the client size, because the size does not
    include the borders, but just the titlebar plus the "real" client content.
    
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler for providing a simple test case based on urxvt for
    debugging this!

    * Creating a screenshot of another layout
    * Display the layout wireframe in the tag list (like KDE2-3, Gnome2)
    * Having and 'ALT-tab' like visual popup for tags

    drawin_update_drawing: Remove optimization for invisible drawins
    
    This fixes the following code:
    
       local d = drawin({})
       d.visible = true
    
    The drawin now has a cairo surface assigned
    
       d.visible = false
       d.width = 1234
       d.visible = true
    
    The width change while the drawin was not visible would not get propagated to
    the drawable because of the code that this patch removes. The expectation was
    that drawin_map() would update the drawable later.
    
    However, because the drawin was already visible, its drawable also already has
    a surface assigned. Thus, drawin_map() wouldn't update the drawable either.
    
    Fix this by just removing this optimizations.

    drawin: Don't special-case moves
    
    The code in drawin_moveresize() tries to be clever and only updates the drawing
    state of the drawable when it is resized, not when it is moved around. This used
    to be necessary because once upon a time, drawin_update_drawing() threw away all
    of the drawing state and thus forcing a repaint. These days it just calls
    drawable_set_geometry() as well and that function special-cases moves.
    
    So this old code in drawin_moveresize() is no longer necessary and actually
    caused problems.
    
    These problems occurred because drawin_update_drawing() is being clever and
    doesn't do anything for .visible = false drawins, because their drawing state
    will be updated once they become visible. However, not skipping
    drawable_set_geometry() means that this broke, because drawin_map() thought that
    the drawing state was up to date while in reality it wasn't.

    wibox.layout.base.rect_to_device_geometry: Fix for "weird" rotations
    
    The old code transformed the top-left and bottom-right corner of the rectangle
    to device space and calculated a rectangle based on these two points. However,
    if you rotate a rectangle by 45°, these two points will be directly above each
    other and thus the old code would calculate a width of 0.
    
    Fix this by transforming all four corners of the rectangle into device space and
    calculating a rectangle based on this.

    gears.wallpaper: Center maximized if no offset set
    
    maximized() used to align the image with (0,0) so that it is shifted to the right or bottom. Most wallpapers are designed from the center, so this behavior is not desired usually. With this commit the wallpaper is centered when no offset is set. To get the old behavior use {x=0, y=0} for the offset parameter.

    awful.tag.move: Fix tag index setting (FS#1249)
    
    Since commit 9c69e857edb6, awful.tag.setscreen() unsets a tag's index to make
    sure things end up in a sane order on the new screen. Thus, the call to
    setscreen() removed the "index" property that tag.move just set.
    
    Fix this by setting the index after the screen.

    gears.surface: Handle the cache more intelligently
    
    It doesn't make sense for surface.load_uncached() to load a file without
    inserting into the cache. The next "cached" load will have to load it again.
    
    So move cache insertion into surface.load_uncached() and the only thing that
    surface.load() does differently is checking if we have a suitable cache entry
    before calling load_uncached().
    
    So load_uncached() does the cache insertion and load() reads from the cache.

    Don't set a background-pixel for our client frame windows
    
    Previously we would get a short black flicker when a client closes. This
    happened because first the client's window would get hidden and only a short
    moment later would awesome react to this and close its own window. In the mean
    time, the X server filled the frame window with its background-pixel which was
    black.
    
    Just removing the background-pixel means we get the default value which is None.
    This means that the content will be left untouched and the client's window will
    be visible for a moment longer.

    gears.surface: Cache files from disk
    
    Instead of loading files from disk every time we need them, add a cache to
    gears.surface as a weak table that maps strings to cairo surfaces.
    
    If this cache should be avoided, there is a new gears.surface.load_uncached()
    function which works just like gears.surface.load() worked before.

    Fix tag screen switching
    
    The bugs this fix are:
    
     * Invalid request using nil as screen
     * Stop messing indexes in the old screen
     * Prevent c.screen <-> t.screen mismatch
     * Prevent no tags being selected in the old screen

    When a screen doesn't have any tags selected, then just tag the new client with

    Also, if we failed at coming up with tags for a client, don't completely untag
    it. This means that it can keep its old tags if it had any.

    awful.tag: Don't tag clients before manage() (FS#1238)
    
    This commit partly reverts commit b4c83d0e702168c5bb.
    
    Because the C code emits property::screen before manage, this caused
    awful.tag.withcurrent() to run on a client before it really was being managed.
    This then tagged the client. Because of this tag changes, awful.layout reacted
    and ran the layout code. Because c.type wasn't set up at this point yet, the
    client wasn't considered to be floating yet. This caused the client's geometry
    to change and thus its floating geometry was messed up.

    wibox.layout.base.fit_widget: Enforce sane width and height
    
    Previously, odd things could happen if a widget was getting fitted into a
    negative width or, even worse, width being NaN (not a number)!
    
    This can e.g. happen due to a margin layout which doesn't get enough space to
    even draw the margin that it is supposed to add.
    
    Fix this by enforcing a minimum value of 0 for the width and height that a
    widget gets fitted into.

    imagebox: Avoid division by zero
    
    Given an imagebox i with i.resize_forbidden = false and a valid image set, the
    call t:fit(0, 0) would return two times "not a number".
    
    This is because the code first does some calculations to get the input image
    into the available space and then tried to do some calculations needed for
    scaling images up.
    
    The first calculation already gave us h == 0 == w, the second calculation would
    then calculate 0/0. This results in NaNs.
    
    This was only noticed because NaN is not a valid table index in lua.
    
    Fix this by returning 0,0 if we have an image of width or height 0 after the
    first calculation. Since 0x0 images are valid in cairo, this also fixes the same
    bug with such images.

    Bump minimum lgi dependency to 0.7.0
    
    Before commit 1b2826 in lgi, the get_rgba() function on cairo SolidPatterns was
    specified like this:
    
        get_rgba = { ret = cairo.Status,
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' },
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' },
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' } },
    
    The above commit fixed this (without saying so) and the code became:
    
        get_rgba = { ret = cairo.Status,
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' },
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' },
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' },
                     { ti.double, dir = 'out' } },
    
    The prototype for the corresponding cairo function is:
    
    cairo_public cairo_status_t
    cairo_pattern_get_rgba (cairo_pattern_t *pattern,
                            double *red, double *green,
                            double *blue, double *alpha);
    
    As you see, this functions gets four double* as arguments and it will save its
    result via those pointers. Old versions of lgi call this function with too few
    arguments and this will cause a segmentation fault when cairo dereferences an
    invalid pointer.

    Drawable: Ignore exposes when we have nothing to draw
    
    The X11 server tells us about things that need to be redrawn via expose events.
    When we get such an expose event before lua drew the drawable, we just fill the
    exposed area with old data (which is black for newly-created drawables).
    
    Fix this by tracking if we have any usable data in a drawable's double buffering
    pixmap. This flag is unset whenever we throw away the old content (e.g. due to a
    resize) and is set when lua gave us some new content to display.

    Only set client's urgent after startup
    
    This looks at awesome.startup in the default 'request::activate' signal
    handler.

    Factor `awful.rules.apply_do` out of `apply`
    
    This allows to apply properties and callbacks to a client like
    awful.rules.apply would do, without the matching part.
    
    This is useful with the new startup notifications, and lets you apply
    the same properties and callbacks from e.g. a manage signal handler.

    drawable: Add pixmap member
    
    Previously, ownership of the pixmaps that we are using for double buffering was
    a little weird. The pixmap belonged to the drawin/titlebar, but the
    corresponding cairo surface was owned by the drawable. Clean this up by moving
    the pixmap to the drawable.
    
    This cleans up lots of ugly code and also fixes a crash: When a drawable was
    garbage collected before its drawin, drawin_wipe() would crash accessing the
    drawable. This was needed to make it forget about the cairo surface we gave to
    it for the pixmap that is being destroyed.
    
    By moving the pixmap to the drawable, this whole issues goes away.

    Redraw titlebars more intelligently
    
    Whenever a titlebar of a client needed to be refreshed, all (possibly) four
    titlebars would get completely refreshed. So if someone actually added more than
    one titlebar to a client, awesome would copy each titlebar's content to the
    window four times. Fix this by introducing more fine-grined functions for
    uploads.
    
    This also makes awesome only update the affected area when it gets an expose
    event for a titlebar instead of all four titlebars completely.

    drawin: Only redraw on move with translucent background
    
    If a drawable has an opaque background, we don't need pseudo transparency and
    thus its content don't change when it is moved. However, when we need pseudo
    transparency, then we have to redraw the drawable to apply the new background.
    
    Previously we just always did the redraw. This commit adds a helper function
    gears.color.create_opaque_pattern() that analyzes a cairo pattern for
    transparency. We use this new function to only redraw-on-move when there is
    actual pseudo transparency in effect. Otherwise, this redraw can be skipped.

    drawin: Don't unconditionally redraw when made visible
    
    Before this commit, we always threw away the drawin's cairo surface whenever it
    was made visible and thus forced a redraw.
    
    This commit changes this so that we only force a redraw if the drawin was
    resized why it wasn't visible. To remember when this happens, we free the
    drawin's cairo surface without allocating a new one when the drawin is resized
    while not being visible. Thus, we then only have to allocate a new surface if
    the drawin doesn't have one when it is being made visible.

    Add end to end support for spawning tracking using startup notifications
    
    This allow to spawn something, then apply some properties or rules when
    the client show up ("manage").
    
    This commit add:
     * "startup_id" property for all clients object (immutable, can be nil)
     * Second return value to awful.util.spawn() with the startup_id
     * Update the documentation
    
    Example:
    
      local wait_for_it = {}
    
      local pid,snid = awful.util.spawn("urxvtc")
      wait_for_it[snid] = {ontop=true,sticky=false,
         tag = awful.tag.gettags(mouse.screen)[1] }
    
      client.connect_signal("manage", function (c, startup)
         if c.startup_id and wait_for_it[c.startup_id] then

    Added Expand Modes
    
    Added set_expand function with options of "none" "outside" or "inside" modes.
    The "inside" mode is the default and will result in the original behavior. The
    main benefit is being able to actually center a widget in the available space
    with options of how to draw the outside widgets (expand to take the space,
    or not.) Further functionality can be had by ommiting one of the outside
    widgets. Set default layout mode in the constructor.

    Emit tag::history::update signal from tag.history.restore
    
    Restoring a previous history entry changes the tag history (in the
    meaning of currently selected tags), and therefore should also emit the

    A use case might be to automatically hide tags with no clients on them.
