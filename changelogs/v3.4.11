    Fix the default config
    
    When I cherry-picked commit 2785d695ce from master, I didn't notice that it uses
    connect_signal() which is add_signal() in 3.4-land. That was half a month ago.
    Since then, no one complaint about this, so no one hit the problem yet?
    
    Ok, it is in the default config which I guess isn't what the people who use
    git/3.4 run. Still, would have been nice to know that people actually test the
    mess which I produce. :-(

    Signal runtime errors via a naughty popup
    
    Whenever awesome's C code calls into lua via a protected call, the debug::error
    signal is emitted on errors. We now use this to give naughty popups for every
    single error that happens. This should help people to notice errors easier.
    
    The only exception are mouse and key grabbers and config loading, those don't go
    through debug::error. I guess that means that the grabbers need to be hooked up
    to debug::error. :-)

    Signal config errors via a naughty popup
    
    If loading of any config file fails, awesome will now remember the error message
    and make it available to lua. The default config is modified to open a naughty
    popup on errors.
    
    This should help all those people who modify their config and then wonder why
    there change is ignored, not noticing awesome's error message on stderr

    Ungrab the server before parsing the config
    
    This moves the loading of the rc.lua and managing of pre-existing clients to
    after we ungrab the server during startup. To make sure we have no races with
    clients which start up parallel to awesome, we do the QueryTree for all the
    clients that we have to manage before the ungrab, but start managing the clients
    only after the ungrab.
    
    This means that we have already selected our event mask on the root window in
    scan() and thus received an UnmapNotify event when we reparent windows into a
    frame window. This has the effect that we immediately unmanage the client again,
    whoops.
    
    To fix this, we grab the server again and remove our event mask on the root
    window again while we reparent.
    
    This should hopefully fix all cases where we deadlock during startup because
    pulseaudio wants to talk to the X server, but is being ignored because we have
    the server grabbed while at the same time we are waiting for pulseaudio.

    Fix restacking with zaphod mode (FS#835)
    
    Boy was this code broken. It tried to stack windows ontop of each other which
    were on different screens. However, since they didn't have the same parent, they
    obviously couldn't be ontop of each other. The X server just reacted with a "wtf
    are you doing?"-kind of error which means the restacking was ignored.
    
    The fix is to restack each screen on its own, completely ignoring any windows
    from other screens.
    
    A big thanks goes to Siarhei Siamashka who bisected this issue and helped me
    debugging it which took quite a while. Finally, he noticed that my first patch
    was broken and also figured out the fix. Thanks!
    
    v2: Move the check on "client_need_stack_refresh" from
    client_stack_refresh_screen() into client_stack_refresh(), so that all screens
    are restacked instead of just the first one.
