    awesomerc: minimize/restore client on a left click in the tasklist entry
    
    In the bundled rc.lua, mouse button 1 on a tasklist entry was configured to
    bring the corresponding client to focus. Modify it to minimize the client if
    already focussed.
    
    Such (default) behavior seems more natural.

    "Handle" events during startup (FS#877)
    
    awesome.c contains this comment:
    
        There can be no events yet, so if his function returns something, it must be
        an error.
    
    Sadly, this wasn't true. It seems like something managed to generate
    MappingNotify events (no idea how).
    
    Fix this by discarding all pending events after our GrabServer, but before we
    ask for SubstructureRedirect on the root window.

    awful.placement.no_overlap: Honor original position
    
    awful.placement.no_overlap caused clients on an otherwise empty desktop to stich
    to the top-left corner of the screen because it always preferred the top-left
    corner of the available space.
    
    This commit doesn't change the way in which the available area is computed, but
    instead this now tries to keep the client at its original position if that is
    available.
    
    This fixes cases where calling awful.placement.no_overlap as a callback from an
    awful.rule rule didn't work because the manage signal in the default config
    later overrode that via calling awful.placement.no_overlap.

    Normalize icon path names (fixes #869).
    
    The elements in ${icon_sources}, as returned by file(GLOB ...) contain

    This patch works around the issue by normalizing all path names in

    the double slashes.

    This fixes a bug where the tasklist would still show its old content after a

    awful.client.floating.toggle: Fix for dialogs
    
    awful.client.floating.get() does some sensible defaults. E.g. dialogs are
    floating by default. Since floating.toggle only checked the property, these
    defaults made it break.
    
    So floating.toggle() should use floating.get to decide if a given client is
    floating. It should also use "false" instead of "nil" when the client is made
    non-floating or else the default will apply again.

    When some client on the left monitor was closed while client.focus is on the

    Correctly unref widget_nodes
    
    While drawing the wibox, the C core builds up a list of widgets and their
    associated geometry. This list consists of widget_node_t objects and is
    constructed like this (This is from luaA_table2widgets()):
    
       widget_node_t w;
       p_clear(&w, 1);
       w.widget = luaA_object_ref_item(L, idx, -1);
       widget_node_array_append(widgets, w);
    
    After we are done with this list of widget nodes, it is freed via
    wibox_widget_node_array_wipe(). However, wibox_widget_node_array_wipe() passed
    "&w" to luaA_object_unref_item() while it should have used "w.widget" (which is
    what was returned from luaA_object_ref_item()). This made the unref fail and the
    wibox was carrying around a reference to this widget forever. This was
    effectively a memory leak.

    {tag,task}list: Use a weak-valued table
    
    The data table is used to map objects (clients/tags) to the buttons associated
    with them. This is done so that we don't have to re-create the button objects
    each time this lists are updated.
    
    The problem was that this weak-keyed table was never cleared, because the value
    had a strong reference to the key (via the button's signal):
    
    btn:connect_signal("press", function () b:emit_signal("press", o) end)
    
    "o" is the key in the table and btn is reachable from the value. This prevented
    the garbage collection of the key. Using a weak-keyed and weak-valued table
    fixes this.

    Use relative paths for the titlebar icons (FS#809)
    
    The current code used "if(MATCHES)" to decide if a path was inside the source
    directory or the build directory. MATCHES uses regular expressions and so this
    check failed miserably if the path contained any characters that have a special
    meaning in regular expressions (e.g. "+").
    
    Fix this by only using paths inside the build dir for the icons. All icons are
    copied from the source dir to the build dir so that we can freely assume that
    everything is inside the build directory.
    
    Instead of trying to "transform" the existing paths from the source dir to the
    build dir, we use "file(GLOB)"'s RELATIVE option that gives us relative path.
    Together with the way "file(COPY)" interprets its arguments, that's all we need.

    awful.placement.no_overlap: Ignore desktop clients
    
    EWMH describes desktop windows like this:
    
    "_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP indicates a desktop feature. This can include a
    single window containing desktop icons with the same dimensions as the screen,
    allowing the desktop environment to have full control of the desktop, without
    the need for proxying root window clicks."
    
    An example for such a window is nautilus' virtual root window. Naturally, such a
    window would always overlap with any given client, so awful.placement.no_overlap
    just didn't do anything at all. The fix is to ignore such clients for placement
    calculations.

    certainly doesn't work for computing the size.

    calculation on its width if its orientation is different from East.

    awful.prompt: "Fix" for multi-byte characters
    
    If you entered a multi-byte character into a prompt and then changed your mind
    and used backspace to fix the character, only the last byte of the character was
    removed. Because pango is intelligent, it noticed the broken utf8 and
    complained.
    
    So far nothing new. But since 711d78b50c23ef8 the textbox will throw a lua error
    when it gets an invalid text (= pango complains). Throwing an unprotected lua
    error in this context causes the keygrabber to be killed which stops the prompt.
    
    Fix this by removing bytes as long as there are bytes left that can be removed.
    
    This is FS#801.

    Always unban a client that we are trying to focus
    
    Previously, if a client had nofocus == true, it wasn't unminimized if sth tried
    to focus it. Also, if this client had the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol, the focusing
    would fail since it's an error to set the input focus to an unviewable window.
    
    For consistency, this also moves the code that sets a client's minimized
    property to false into client_unban() since it doesn't make sense to have a
    minimized client unbanned (i.e. visible).

    If this property is true, setting "client.focus" to this client might have some

    client_unmanage: Update WM_STATE later
    
    According to ICCCM, if a client wants to reuse one of its windows, it has to

    Kick out the systray when wiping a wibox
    
    When a wibox is destroyed or detached from a screen, it is wiped to clean up its
    resources. This also includes destroying the window which is associated with the
    wibox.
    
    The problem here is that if the wibox contains the systray, the systray window
    would automatically be destroyed since all childs of a window are destroyed when
    said window is destroyed. To fix this, we kick out the systray window before
    destroying the wibox' window.

    Add systray windows to the save-set
    
    When an X11 client disconnects from the X server, all of its windows are
    destroyed. This also means that all the sub-windows of those windows are
    destroyed which is not necessary what one wants to happen.
    
    To work around this, X11 has a "save-set". All the windows that are in the
    save-set are reparented to their closest ancestor when they would normally be
    destroyed. This is just what this code needs. :)

    Thanks for the kind comments and for your quick reply, I'm glad you
    find this contribution useful.
    
    I also noticed that in the previous patch there is a line that was not
    supposed to be there, since its purpose was to help debugging the

    Basic support for manpages in multiple languages
    
    The patch changes the path where the manual pages are compiled, resulting in
    a tree structure that follows the man-db convention: the man pages of each
    language are stored in a subdirectory of the main man path. For example, the
    input file "$AWESOME_SRC/manpages/awesome.1.fr.txt" would be compiled as
    "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/fr/man1/awesome.1". The installation step just copies
    the resulting directory (in the example, "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/") into the
    global man path of the system, excluding the temporary files.
    
    The input .txt files for the translations are not added directly to
    AWE_MAN_FILES: instead, the new variable AWE_MAN_LANGS stores the language
    names and their input file names are generated automatically. The main
    reason of this modification is that it was more convenient for my testing
    purposes: this behaviour can be changed back with minor modifications to the
    code. This patch is supposed to be a first draft, after all, and it is far
    from being perfect, but I hope it is of help.

    Use WM_STATE_NORMAL as default
    
    If a window didn't have a WM_STATE set, xwindow_get_state_reply() returned 0
    which just happened to be XCB_WM_STATE_WITHDRAWN. This caused issues in scan().
    
    Instead, we now assume a window is in state normal if no state is explicitly
    set, which makes a lot more sense and fixes actual bugs.

    Check for UNMAPPED instead of UNVIEWABLE
    
    A window is unmapped if it is not mapped (oh noes! ;). If it is mapped, it can
    be either mapped or unviewable. If any of its ancestors is unmapped, it's
    unviewable, else it's unmapped
    
    Since this code looks at children of the root window, it should never be seeing
    clients which are unviewable (can one unmap the root window at all...?). What
    this really wants to check for is unmapped, so this patch implements this.

    awful.wibox: update struts on align()
    
    Setting width or height (horizontal or vertical) to an arbitrary value
    causes the wibox not to be stretched. Instead the align() function is
    called, which might not modify any wibox property in many situations,
    or none when align parameter was not provided by the user. The major
    side effect is that wibox struts were never updated and clients
    covered the wibox (until a first signal handler caused struts to be
    updated).

    Fix possible memory corruption (FS#734)
    
    The memory referred to by the reply argument of
    property_update_wm_protocols is automatically free'd
    by xcb later on, so it is not safe to simply use the
    value of reply in our own data structures. If we did
    this, future calls to xcb_get_wm_protocols_reply_wipe
    free the data which has already been free'd by xcb,
    causing a double-free and corrupting the heap. In
    addition, it isn't safe to use free'd memory as if
    it is still allocated. Instead, duplicate the data
    referred to by reply and use the duplicate instead.
    
    It seems to me as if the duplication should actually
    be done in xcb_get_wm_protocols_from_reply, but I'm
    not really sure. If that is the case, this is simply
    a work-around until xcb can be fixed.

    awful.widget: add progressbar set_max_value property
    
    The awful.widget.graph allows to change the maximum value a graph can
    handle, thus allows users to use widgets and scripts that don't scale
    the values down to 0 - 1 range. The progressbars did not allow this
    and worked with a hard-coded value of 1.

    awsetbg: add fvwm-root support
    
    fvwm-root is a part of the FVWM window manager, and is one of those
    utilities that properly support transparency because it can retain and
    publish the Pixmap with which the background has been set. It supports
    XBM, XPM, PNG and SVG image formats, but is not very rich in options
    as opposed to habak or feh.

    awful.menu: sanitize support for access keys
    
    Commit 87070ca introduced support for access keys in menus. Chosen
    character was "&", an XML entity that has potential to cause problems;
    if a user tries to add multiple access keys or just put an ampersand
    in the name of the item the menu will break. Breaking happened because
    ampersands were not escaped - first one was substituted and the rest
    were ignored, but not escaped which triggered a pango markup error.

    awful.menu: support for access keys
    
    You can define a menuitem like before:
    
    awful.menu({ items = { { "&awesome", myawesomemenu,
                                beautiful.awesome_icon },
                           { "open &terminal", terminal },
               })
    
    and the letters following the ampersand in itemname can be used as
    access key. (at least former fvwm users might find this familiar)
    
    When there are submenus open awesome ascends during the search from the
    current menu to the top level menu.
    
    The access key is shown underlined.
    
    There is no warning for multiple used keys, only the first one found
    gets the price.

    Commit a757dda replaced the awful.client.movetotag call with c:tags()
    in the tag property handler. Which introduced a regression when more
    than one screen is used. The awful.tag.withcurrent function was being

    screen is set to the tag screen to ensure the client is moved to the
    correct tag and screen.

    wibox: fix align
    
    awful.wibox.align() in 3.4.x gets the available screen area from
    capi.screen[screen].geometry.
    
    this can easily result in overlapping wiboxes since the work area
    provided does not account for existing wiboxes.
    
    In my configuration I use a vertical wibox positioned at the
    right and it half-overlaps my top wibox because it is streched and
    hard-coded to align at the middle.

    Handle synthetic UnmapNotify events
    
    According to the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual, if you want to
    switch your window to withdrawn state, you unmap it and send a synthetic
    UnmapNotify to the root window.
    
    This synthetic event fixes a race condition. When you map and unmap a window
    quickly, the map will generate a MapRequest for the WM but won't actually map
    the window. Thus, the unmap will be discarded (-> window not yet mapped) and the
    window stays map once the WM handles the MapRequest
    
    Before this patch, awesome just ignored the synthetic unmap notify which caused
    the bug to appear again. With this patch it doesn't happen anymore.

    image: Use imlib2's image cache
    
    This makes imlib add images loaded from files to its image cache again. That way
    we avoid loading the same image again and again (e.g. if you cycle through the
    list layouts all the layout icons are loaded).
    
    To not reintroduce FS#651 (fixed in 2dadce9b), we call
    imlib_image_set_changes_on_disk(). This causes two stat() calls if the same file
    is loaded again to check if the file's timestamps changed which is still less
    expensive than loading the whole image again.

    Rules: check if properties of a rule exist
    
    Actually check if properties are set now, since we can also only
    apply callbacks now.

    awful.menu: use actual wibox border width
    
    We check the wibox border width for inappropiate values now, if we set
    border_width to a negative value (invalid) in our theme and draw it, the
    actual border_width will be 0 so the menu will be drawn incorrectly.
    This fixed this.

    awful.autofocus: fix multiple screens autofocus
    
    There might be multiple screens with visible windows. When closing the
    last window of the current screen, try to focus them as well.
    
    If no window has focus and yet some windows are visible (e.g. on another
    screen), awesome misbehaves: it uses sloppy keyboard focus (as is the X11
    default), but doesn't refresh their border colors or tasklists etc.

    Wibox: Check if a window exists before changing it
    
    wibox_set_border_color() and luaA_wibox_set_border_width() didn't check if a
    wibox really had an associated X11 window before changing this window which
    resulted in (silent) errors.

    awful.tooltip: call set_geometry on show()
    
    Function set_geometry was never called if the timer_function argument
    was omitted. show function only called place() which would not display
    a tooltip since it didn't have proper geometry.
