    awful.tag.setscreen: Check if old_screen == new_screen
    
    Setting a tag's screen to what it already is shouldn't have any bad effects.
    However, this code messed up the tag order and selection status.
    
    Fix this by returning early if the tag already has the right screen.

    awful.tag.move: Fix tag index setting
    
    Since commit 9c69e857edb6, awful.tag.setscreen() unsets a tag's index to make
    sure things end up in a sane order on the new screen. Thus, the call to
    setscreen() removed the "index" property that tag.move just set.
    
    Fix this by setting the index after the screen.

    gears.surface: Handle the cache more intelligently
    
    It doesn't make sense for surface.load_uncached() to load a file without
    inserting into the cache. The next "cached" load will have to load it again.
    
    So move cache insertion into surface.load_uncached() and the only thing that
    surface.load() does differently is checking if we have a suitable cache entry
    before calling load_uncached().
    
    So load_uncached() does the cache insertion and load() reads from the cache.

    imagebox: Don't try to scale by infinite (FS#1248)
    
    When an imagebox was drawn with width or height zero, it tried to calculate the
    needed scale factor for making the image fit. Sadly, this would be a division by
    zero aka infinite in this case.
    
    Fix this by just not drawing anything if there is no space available.
