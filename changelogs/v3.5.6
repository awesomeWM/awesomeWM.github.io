    awful.mouse.finder: Remove rounded_corners call
    
    Let's just quote a mail I received from Rastislav Barlik:
    
    I tried to make use of awful.mouse.finder but I found out that it's not working
    as supporting functions rounded_corners were removed with commit

    Vim style menu navigation in addition to arrow keys
    
    Is there a reason it shouldn't be on by default? I'm not familiar enough with the code-base to tell if it will clash with anything.

    Unmap minimized clients
    
    Because ICCCM pretty much mandates that minimized (aka "iconic") clients are
    unmapped. In detail: To go back to normal state, the client should map its
    window and for this to work, the window needs to be unmapped.
    
    Thanks to Oleg Shparber for reporting some issue he had with a self-written Qt
    program and for providing a simple and short test case.

    Don't set a background-pixel for our client frame windows
    
    Previously we would get a short black flicker when a client closes. This
    happened because first the client's window would get hidden and only a short
    moment later would awesome react to this and close its own window. In the mean
    time, the X server filled the frame window with its background-pixel which was
    black.
    
    Just removing the background-pixel means we get the default value which is None.
    This means that the content will be left untouched and the client's window will
    be visible for a moment longer.

    Implement icon_pixmap and icon_mask from WM_HINTS (FS#1297)
    
    Fun fact: ICCCM specifies that icon_pixmap must have depth 1. Xterm uses a
    pixmap with depth 24. Yay... As such, I don't have any test for the depth == 1
    case and will just assume that it does the right thing. If it doesn't, I bet no
    one will notice anyway.

    Don't move clients on ConfigureRequests (FS#1030)
    
    I never saw a single program that set a border on its own windows. However,
    awesome commonly sets borders on its clients and the position of a client is the
    part outside of the border. So when processing a position request from a client,
    we also have to include this border and fix things up correspondingly.
    
    However, the same isn't needed for the client size, because the size does not
    include the borders, but just the titlebar plus the "real" client content.
    
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler for providing a simple test case based on urxvt for
    debugging this!

    layouts: Allow layouts to be invoked with fake data
    
    This patch allows 2 things to be done:
    
    * Write unit test to validate layouts using fake clients and tags
    * Query the current layout geometry from another tag
    
    The advantages of the former are clear and simple. Those of the later include:
    
    * Creating a screenshot of another layout
    * Display the layout wireframe in the tag list (like KDE2-3, Gnome2)
    * Having and 'ALT-tab' like visual popup for tags

    wibox.layout.base.rect_to_device_geometry: Fix for "weird" rotations
    
    The old code transformed the top-left and bottom-right corner of the rectangle
    to device space and calculated a rectangle based on these two points. However,
    if you rotate a rectangle by 45°, these two points will be directly above each
    other and thus the old code would calculate a width of 0.
    
    Fix this by transforming all four corners of the rectangle into device space and
    calculating a rectangle based on this.

    drawin_update_drawing: Remove optimization for invisible drawins
    
    This fixes the following code:
    
       local d = drawin({})
       d.visible = true
    
    The drawin now has a cairo surface assigned
    
       d.visible = false
       d.width = 1234
       d.visible = true
    
    The width change while the drawin was not visible would not get propagated to
    the drawable because of the code that this patch removes. The expectation was
    that drawin_map() would update the drawable later.
    
    However, because the drawin was already visible, its drawable also already has
    a surface assigned. Thus, drawin_map() wouldn't update the drawable either.
    
    Fix this by just removing this optimizations.

    drawin: Don't special-case moves
    
    The code in drawin_moveresize() tries to be clever and only updates the drawing
    state of the drawable when it is resized, not when it is moved around. This used
    to be necessary because once upon a time, drawin_update_drawing() threw away all
    of the drawing state and thus forcing a repaint. These days it just calls
    drawable_set_geometry() as well and that function special-cases moves.
    
    So this old code in drawin_moveresize() is no longer necessary and actually
    caused problems.
    
    These problems occurred because drawin_update_drawing() is being clever and
    doesn't do anything for .visible = false drawins, because their drawing state
    will be updated once they become visible. However, not skipping
    drawable_set_geometry() means that this broke, because drawin_map() thought that
    the drawing state was up to date while in reality it wasn't.
