    update to libxcb 1.4 and xcb-util 0.3.6
    
    These new versions provide similar fields to Xlib for errors
    (major_code, minor_code and resource_id).

    Clear the signal mask for child processes
    
    This adds a callback function which glib calls after it fork()'d and did all the
    necessary setup. This callback function clears our signal mask.
    
    This is necessary because libev 3.8 and later use signalfd and therefor have to
    add those signals to the signal mask. Processes started through awesome would
    inherit this signal mask and I can tell you, some app which ignores ctrl-c
    confuses people a lot.

    Inline g_spawn_command_line_async() into awesome
    
    This adds a new function spawn_proc_helper() which just contains a copy of
    g_spawn_command_line_async()'s source code. This means that there should be no
    behavior change at all here.
