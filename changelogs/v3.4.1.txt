    wibox: check if a wibox' window exists before modifying it
    
    If you change the .bg of an existing wibox which isn't attached to any screen
    yet, then there is no window for which we can update the XCB_CW_BACK_PIXEL.

    wibox: make sure no garbage is painted to the screen
    
    Wiboxes are lazily updated. This means that we could receive an expose event on
    them between making them visible and actually painting their content.
    
    Due to this we were copying undefined content to the wibox, because the pixmap
    was only created just now, but it wasn't actually filled with anything yet.

    Set a wibox' bit gravity to NorthWest.
    
    After the last patch, after each resize the X server fills the complete wibox
    with its background color which means that the widgets will still flicker. This
    patch fixes this by setting the wibox' bit gravity to NorthWest.
    
    This means that if a wibox is enlarged, only the new, larger part will be filled
    with the wibox' background color and the rest of the wibox' content will be left
    intact. With this patch I couldn't see any flickering anymore.

    wibox: Set a proper back pixel
    
    Currently wiboxes have their background set to "inherit parent pixmap". That
    means that each time a wibox is e.g. resized, the X server sets the wibox'
    content to the wallpaper and then immediately awesome redraws the wibox with the
    proper background. This causes flicker when you e.g. resize clients which have a
    titlebar.
    
    With this patch, wiboxes get their proper background color for their "back
    pixel" value. Now, instead of showing the wallpaper, the X server will fill the
    complete wibox with its background color.
    
    With this patch, the actual widgets will still flicker. Also, if the wibox has a
    background image, this image obviously won't be used by the X server and we get
    some flicker again. My next patch will address these issues.
