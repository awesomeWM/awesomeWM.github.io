    wibox button: Fix the x/y position in button events
    
    The coordinates as used by X11 place (0, 0) at the top-left corner of the
    window, including its border. However, this code wants the position relative to
    the drawin's content, thus we also need to substract the border width.

    awful.placement.no_offscreen: Fix border handling (FS#1065)
    
    The (x,y) position of a client is outside of the border, but the width/height
    does not include the border (so the real width is width+2*border).
    
    This means that we have to also subtract 2*border to make sure that the client
    including its border really is inside of the expected area.

    mouse.resize: Allow resize across screens (FS#1059)
    
    No clue why this code is here, but it only allowed floating clients to be
    resized beyond the edge of their screen. Clients on a floating layout were
    forced to stay on their screen. Quite an unintuitive behavior and now this
    behavior is gone.

    Correctly handle focus across restarts (FS#1055)
    
    X11 is a great protocol. When a window manager dies, it can make sure that
    client windows don't get destroyed via the save-set. However, revert-to-parent
    focus handling means that the focus now shifts to the parent which gets
    destroyed and afterwards the focus is "none", which is a really bad state.
    
    Fix this in two places:
    
    First, when shutting down, we switch to PointerRoot mode. This makes sure that
    the input focus follows the mouse pointer if no window manager is started.
    
    Also make sure that we set the input focus the way we want it to be after start
    up. This obviously cleans up any weird state which might exist before we manage
    the input focus.

    Update titlebar color when focus changes (FS#1056)
    
    The current code relied on some widget to cause a redraw when the focus changes.
    Obviously, this assumption is wrong.
    
    Instead, the code now uses the proper "focus" and "unfocus" signals for setting
    titlebar colors, but it also needs to set these colors when a new titlebar is
    created (v1 of this patch forgot that). For this reason, update_colors has to be
    saved for when a titlebar's colors are updated.
    
    This commit also reverts the ugly redraw_hook hack from commit a1918b8306f3a03.

    Use glib instead of libev
    
    This commit ports awesome from libev to the glib main loop. This means that
    awesome has fewer dependencies, because we were already depending on glib before
    and now no longer need glib.
    
    However, the main reason for this change is that, thanks to lgi, we have glib
    bindings for lua. This means that lua code can add all kinds of event sources to
    the main loop (timeouts, fd watchers, SIGCHLD watchers, ....). Yay

    Fix a bug when switching fullscreen mode
    
    The code assumed that a window gets resized when it enters/leaves the fullscreen
    mode. This was needed because the code for resizing a window hides and shows the
    titlebars.
    
    However, it is possible for a window to enter/leave fullscreen mode without
    getting resized, because it already has the correct geometry. In this case,
    titlebars were not handled correctly.
    
    This commit fixes that by forcing a resize to the current geometry when the
    fullscreen flag is toggled.

    Drawin: Re-add shape support
    
    Commit 03e0ee53d2b1f2e7bac removed window shapes, because at the time I was too
    lazy to port them from the old image system to oocairo.
    
    This commit re-adds them, but for now only as a way to set the shape.

    wibox.drawables: Fix a memleak
    
    Drawables could never be garbage-collected, because of the "wallpaper_changed"
    signal. The callback function for this signal kept a strong reference to the
    drawable.
    
    Fix this by putting all drawable's draw() methods into a weakly keyed tabled so
    that the strong reference to them disappears.

    drawin: Update the drawable's geometry on move
    
    We only need to update a drawin's drawing related resources when its size
    changes. Thus, when a drawin is just moved, drawin_update_drawing() is not
    called. However, this function was used for telling the drawin's drawable about
    its geometry. This means that the drawable had an outdated idea about what its
    geometry was.
    
    Fix this by making sure to always call drawable_set_geometry().

    common/util.h: dodgy non-__GNUC__ p_delete
    
    I assume nobody have tried to compile Awesome with GNU uncompatible
    compiler for ages and thus non-__GNUC__ p_delete version got
    overlooked for quite some time.
    First of all, a problem I see is that it assigns void** to a variable
    of type void* and then dereferences the same void* variable.
    None of the compilers I am aware of will let you go through this
    without an error.
    And second of all, lets have one portable p_delete.

    The commit "Remove all traces of awsetbg and wallpaper setters" removed these.
    This commit adds them back, but they are now applied a little different. The

    Ignore (Un)Grab focus notifies
    
    When a keyboard grab activate/deactives, the input focus jumps to the window
    which does the grab. These FocusIn events sometimes managed to confuse awesome.
    The symptom was that a newly mapped/started client didn't receive the input
    focus:
    
    - You press your key-combo to start a terminal. This activates a passive grab
      and the input focus jumps to the root window
    - The terminal opens and the "manage" rule does client.focus = c
    - This doesn't set the focus yet, but instead causes
      globalconf.focus.need_update = true and .client = new_terminal
    - Before the focus is updated, the key combo is released and the focus jumps
      back to the previously focused client
    - The FocusIn with mode == Ungrab causes awesome to think that the previously
      focused client got focused again and thus globalconf.client.focus gets re-set
      to what it was before
    - Finally the focus is refreshed and the previously focused client gets focused
    
    The fix is simple: We don't need the FocusIn events which are generated when a
    grab activates or deactivates, so we can just ignore them.
    
    Thanks to Majic for reporting this to me.

    awful.rules: Implement callbacks for individual properties
    
    When a property is now set to a function, the function's return value will be
    used for the value of the property. The function gets the new client as its only
    argument.
    
    There is no property which accepts a function as its value and thus this change
    can't break anything (yeah, famous last words...).

    Ignore re-focusing the focused client
    
    When something gives the input focus to the client which already has the input
    focus, bad things can happen. Normally, you'd expect nothing to happen in this
    case, but X11 is not that simple.
    
    When updating the input focus and the focused client has the nofocus hint set,
    we are actually taking away the focus from this client.
    
    Hopefully this fixes FS#973.

    Don't change focus in response to FocusIn events
    
    Previously, when we received a FocusIn event, we would update the input focus,
    because client_focus_update set globalconf.focus.need_update to true.
    
    However, this is wrong for clients following the globally active focus model,
    because in this case its the client which controls which window has the input
    focus. It could happen that we thus took away the focus from the client which
    just gave itself the focus.

    Without this, input handling is broken (draw_widget() registers each widget with

    I am using lgi v0.6.1 and that is not convertable to number value,

    FS#996: awful.ewmh: Connect to property::border_width signal
    
    For example, I have some lua code which sets the border width based on the
    number of visible clients. When just a single client is visible, the border
    width is 0, else it's what the theme says.
    
    Previously, this caused visible "glitches" for fullscreen'd and maximized
    clients. This patch fixes that and updates the client's geometry and
    border width appropriately.
    
    This has a slight chance of going into an endless loop if someone sets a
    fullscreen'd clients border width from its property::border_width signal.
    Just don't do that!
    
    Thanks to Arvydas Sidorenko for finding this issue.

    unset hidden state when a client regains focus
    
    This should be the expected behavior, imo.  Otherwise the client doesn't appear
    in tasklist regardless of being focussed.

    awful.client.setslave: Fix for not-visible clients
    
    Previously, setslave() put a client only at the end of the list of visible
    clients. Obviously this means that it didn't do anything helpful if the target
    client was not visible.
    
    Fix this by iterating over all clients on the target screen instead of just the
    visible ones.

    We still have to add the border_width to the parent menu's width so that the

    Signal runtime errors via a naughty popup
    
    Whenever awesome's C code calls into lua via a protected call, the debug::error
    signal is emitted on errors. We now use this to give naughty popups for every
    single error that happens. This should help people to notice errors easier.
    
    The only exception are mouse and key grabbers and config loading, those don't go
    through debug::error. I guess that means that the grabbers need to be hooked up
    to debug::error. :-)

    tag.withcurrent(): Also tag sticky clients (FS#934)
    
    Tagging sticky clients shouldn't hurt anything, but it helps a lot if the client

    Ungrab the server before parsing the config
    
    This moves the loading of the rc.lua and managing of pre-existing clients to
    after we ungrab the server during startup. To make sure we have no races with
    clients which start up parallel to awesome, we do the QueryTree for all the
    clients that we have to manage before the ungrab, but start managing the clients
    only after the ungrab.
    
    This means that we have already selected our event mask on the root window in
    scan() and thus received an UnmapNotify event when we reparent windows into a
    frame window. This has the effect that we immediately unmanage the client again,
    whoops.
    
    To fix this, we grab the server again and remove our event mask on the root
    window again while we reparent.
    
    This should hopefully fix all cases where we deadlock during startup because
    pulseaudio wants to talk to the X server, but is being ignored because we have
    the server grabbed while at the same time we are waiting for pulseaudio.

    drawin: Don't cause X11 errors during allocation
    
    We were only creating an X11 window for a new drawin after we handled all the

    would try to resize the window before we created a window, which caused an X11

    Fix possible crash on shutdown (FS#904)
    
    Open some windows, select a layout which does something (=not floating) and
    restart awesome. It's likely that it will crash during the shutdown.
    
    The reason is that awesome cleans up various state before going down. This is
    mostly all the lua state. However, drawin_wipe, which is called for cleaning up
    after a drawin, dared to emit a sigal which then let various lua code run which
    had access to objects which were already destroyed.
    
    Various bad things can happen this way, in this situation it was a crash when an
    already-destroyed client was resized.
    
    The fix is to move the signal out of drawin_wipe. It doesn't belong there
    anyway. Instead, property::workarea should be emitted when the drawin's visible
    property changes as this is when the workarea changes, too (screen_area_get()
    only looks at visible drawins).

    Correctly position wiboxes (FS#892)
    
    Let's just quote the bug report:
    
    A regression was introduced in commit f5a5af4001723bdacd58474445424a745f343ec8
    which causes wiboxes to position themselves incorrectly on Xinerama screens
    besides the first one. In lib/awful/wibox.lua.in line 49, function
    set_position(), the screen number used to use wibox.screen but now just defaults
    to 1. Since the screen parameter is never actually passed to set_position(),
    that means that wiboxes will always use screen 1's geometry when determining the
    proper position. So, if a different screen is larger or smaller or isn't aligned
    with the primary screen, the wibox will either be offscreen or not on the edge.
    
    This should be fixed by explicitly passing the right screen argument to all
    functions which need it.

    So you want to make all Firefox windows floating except the main window
    (instance = Navigator). You can either list all possible windows in

      except = { instance = "Navigator" },

    Turn globalonf.drawins into the list of visible drawins
    
    This fixes a crash when the opacity of a not-visible drawin is changed. This
    happened because we got a PropertyNotify for our own change of _NET_WM_OPACITY
    and then tried to set the drawin's opacity to this new value.
    
    However, the drawin was only reachable through globalconf.drawins and wasn't
    ref'd in lua.  This means that the luaA_object_push() call in
    property_handle_net_wm_opacity() didn't find the drawin and instead pushed a
    nil. This then later caused an unprotected lua error in window_set_opacity().

    drawin: Remove screen property
    
    There isn't much point in the screen property of a drawin because the geometry
    already defines on which screen the drawin is.
    
    The biggest chunk of changes from this is due to removing the functions
    drawin_detach and drawin_attach which where called when the screen property was
    set/unset.
    
    The code from drawin_detach is moved into drawin_set_visible and drawin_wipe.
    drawin_attach is moved into drawin_init.

    Simplify drawin screen handling
    
    Instead of creating/destroying a window whenever the drawin is attached/detached
    from some screen, a window is now created when the drawin is created and it
    isn't destroyed until the drawin is garbage collected.
    
    Since we can now safely assume that a drawin always has a associated window,
    this should make it possible to simplify some stuff.

    awful.placement.no_overlap: Honor original position
    
    awful.placement.no_overlap caused clients on an otherwise empty desktop to stich
    to the top-left corner of the screen because it always preferred the top-left
    corner of the available space.
    
    This commit doesn't change the way in which the available area is computed, but
    instead this now tries to keep the client at its original position if that is
    available.
    
    This fixes cases where calling awful.placement.no_overlap as a callback from an
    awful.rule rule didn't work because the manage signal in the default config
    later overrode that via calling awful.placement.no_overlap.

    awful.client.floating.toggle: Fix for dialogs
    
    awful.client.floating.get() does some sensible defaults. E.g. dialogs are
    floating by default. Since floating.toggle only checked the property, these
    defaults made it break.
    
    So floating.toggle() should use floating.get to decide if a given client is
    floating. It should also use "false" instead of "nil" when the client is made
    non-floating or else the default will apply again.

    Send correct signals when c.name updates
    
    When a client sets WM_NAME (client->alt_name) but doesn't set _NET_WM_NAME
    (client->name), we give alt_name to lua when c.name is used. However, we still
    emitted property::alt_name instead of property::name to lua. Obviously, this
    breaks stuff.
    
    (The same applies to client->alt_icon_name)

    naughty: Try ignoring all markup before giving up
    
    naughty now tries to ignore all pango markup by using :set_text() instead of
    :set_markup(). If this fails, too, we must have been fed invalid utf8 which we
    cannot do anything about.

    Unban clients when they are focused
    
    In commit 3dbf89c I removed a client_unban() in the code path for focusing
    clients. The idea was that client focusing is now done after rebanning, so that
    it should already be visible by the time this code is executed.
    
    However, minimized clients obviously don't get unbanned, So we have to call
    client_unban() here to make sure the client is unminimized.

    wibox: Fix mouse event handling
    
    If you managed to press mouse button 4 exactly between two entries in the
    taglist, the taglist would jump by two tags instead of just one. This is because
    the mouse event was forwarded to both taglist items.
    
    This happened because the calculation in wibox' find_widgets() was wrong. If you
    have a widget at (1, 1) with a size of 1x1, then (1, 1) is the only point that
    this widget covers. However, the math also included the pixels (2, 1), (1, 2)
    and (2, 2) in the widget's extents. This is obviously wrong.

    Instead of immediately setting the X11 input focus when client.focus is assigned

    wibox.layout.fixed: Always draw "empty" widgets
    
    If a widget has a width/height of 0, we can safely draw it without running out
    of the available space. This code checks if we got enough space after we now how
    much space the next widget wants.
    
    This fixes the systray. It has to be drawn at least once so that the C core can
    set up stuff correctly. However, thanks to the systray having a width of 0, it
    wasn't drawn by the layout.

    If awesome is started with that flag, it won't use ARGB visuals. Theoretically,
    this shouldn't be necessary, but it seems like this triggers bugs in the X

    Flush the cairo surface after drawing
    
    It is perfectly valid for a cairo surface to delay the actual. This is mostly
    done in situations where it speeds stuff up. Since we want our drawing to be
    visible, we have to flush the cairo surface when we are done drawing.

    Use an ARGB visual if one is available (FS#829)
    
    With this commit, awesome prefers ARGB visuals over the screen's default visual.
    This means that all our (visible) windows now can get an alpha channel that a
    compositing manager can use for producing transparent windows.
    
    The reason why this is done is to fix a bug. We are reparenting clients into
    other windows. If one of these client window uses an ARGB visual, its
    transparency would have no effect.

    Associate our default GC with the systray window
    
    The window that is specified when a GC is created is used for two things. First,
    it specifies which protocol screen the GC should be associated with. Second, it
    specifies for which color depth the GC is valid.
    
    Due to this second property, we have to use the systray window instead of the
    root window. The systray window uses globalconf.default_depth.

    Make sure we set some required values on windows
    
    All windows which use globalconf.default_depth must also have a backpixel,
    borderpixel and colormap set when they are created. Without this, all these
    xcb_create_window() calls would fail when globalconf.default_depth is no longer
    the screen's default depth.

    Track the number of objects
    
    With this patch, we track the number of objects that are alive for any class.
    This information can be accessed via class.instances()
    
    For example:
    
      print("wiboxes", wibox.instances())
      print("widgets", widget.instances())

    widget layouts: Check the number of geometries
    
    If we called the widget layout for x widgets, but the layouts returned less
    geometries than this, we silently ignored the left-over widgets. If the layouts
    returned more geometries, we crashed.
    
    Fix this by verifying that the number of widgets and the number of geometries
    are equal. If they are different, we use the smaller of the two.

    Correctly unref widget_nodes
    
    While drawing the wibox, the C core builds up a list of widgets and their
    associated geometry. This list consists of widget_node_t objects and is
    constructed like this (This is from luaA_table2widgets()):
    
       widget_node_t w;
       p_clear(&w, 1);
       w.widget = luaA_object_ref_item(L, idx, -1);
       widget_node_array_append(widgets, w);
    
    After we are done with this list of widget nodes, it is freed via
    wibox_widget_node_array_wipe(). However, wibox_widget_node_array_wipe() passed
    "&w" to luaA_object_unref_item() while it should have used "w.widget" (which is
    what was returned from luaA_object_ref_item()). This made the unref fail and the
    wibox was carrying around a reference to this widget forever. This was
    effectively a memory leak.

    {tag,task}list: Use a weak-valued table
    
    The data table is used to map objects (clients/tags) to the buttons associated
    with them. This is done so that we don't have to re-create the button objects
    each time this lists are updated.
    
    The problem was that this weak-keyed table was never cleared, because the value
    had a strong reference to the key (via the button's signal):
    
    btn:connect_signal("press", function () b:emit_signal("press", o) end)
    
    "o" is the key in the table and btn is reachable from the value. This prevented
    the garbage collection of the key. Using a weak-keyed and weak-valued table
    fixes this.

    Use relative paths for the titlebar icons (FS#809)
    
    The current code used "if(MATCHES)" to decide if a path was inside the source
    directory or the build directory. MATCHES uses regular expressions and so this
    check failed miserably if the path contained any characters that have a special
    meaning in regular expressions (e.g. "+").
    
    Fix this by only using paths inside the build dir for the icons. All icons are
    copied from the source dir to the build dir so that we can freely assume that
    everything is inside the build directory.
    
    Instead of trying to "transform" the existing paths from the source dir to the
    build dir, we use "file(GLOB)"'s RELATIVE option that gives us relative path.
    Together with the way "file(COPY)" interprets its arguments, that's all we need.

    awful.placement.no_overlap: Ignore desktop clients
    
    EWMH describes desktop windows like this:
    
    "_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP indicates a desktop feature. This can include a
    single window containing desktop icons with the same dimensions as the screen,
    allowing the desktop environment to have full control of the desktop, without
    the need for proxying root window clicks."
    
    An example for such a window is nautilus' virtual root window. Naturally, such a
    window would always overlap with any given client, so awful.placement.no_overlap
    just didn't do anything at all. The fix is to ignore such clients for placement
    calculations.

    awful.prompt: "Fix" for multi-byte characters
    
    If you entered a multi-byte character into a prompt and then changed your mind
    and used backspace to fix the character, only the last byte of the character was
    removed. Because pango is intelligent, it noticed the broken utf8 and
    complained.
    
    So far nothing new. But since 711d78b50c23ef8 the textbox will throw a lua error
    when it gets an invalid text (= pango complains). Throwing an unprotected lua
    error in this context causes the keygrabber to be killed which stops the prompt.
    
    Fix this by removing bytes as long as there are bytes left that can be removed.
    
    This is FS#801.

    Use signal emitions on classes
    
    Since 3fbb5f1535dfd0d49d73b "luaobject: emit signals on class too" when a signal
    is emitted on some object, it will also be emitted on the class. This means that
    we don't have to connect our signals via the "new" signal anymore, but can
    instead connect to the signal on the class.
    
    (Of course, the signal on the class gets as first argument the object on which
    the signal was emitted)

    Always unban a client that we are trying to focus
    
    Previously, if a client had nofocus == true, it wasn't unminimized if sth tried
    to focus it. Also, if this client had the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol, the focusing
    would fail since it's an error to set the input focus to an unviewable window.
    
    For consistency, this also moves the code that sets a client's minimized
    property to false into client_unban() since it doesn't make sense to have a
    minimized client unbanned (i.e. visible).

    Ignore all UnmapNotifies due to the root window
    
    We got XCB_EVENT_MASK_SUBSTRUCTURE_NOTIFY on the root window, but we also have
    XCB_EVENT_MASK_STRUCTURE_NOTIFY on the individual client windows. Since we are
    reparenting our windows, we can safely ignore all UnmapNotifies that we get
    through the root window.
    
    This fixes a bug if there were any windows already present before awesome
    started. Those were obviously already mapped which means that ReparentWindow
    would cause an UnmapNotify for them on the root window. This commit makes us
    ignore that UnmapNotify and thus not throwing away the window immediately again.

    Overhaul property handling
    
    For each property we handle, there is now a function which sends a request and
    returns the cookie and a second function that takes the cookie and saves the
    result in the client_t struct. This should make it possible to improve our
    latency later on.

    Clear our event mask in client_unmanage()
    
    This should fix an actual race condition:
    - Client unmaps its window (UnmapNotify for awesome)
    - Client maps its window (MapRequest for awesome)
    - Due to the UnmapNotify: client_unmanage() runs and reparents the window back
      to the root (ReparentNotify)
    - Due to the MapRequest: client_manage() runs
    - Due to the ReparentNotify: We call client_unmanage() again and now the
      client's window is lost.

    Kick out the systray when wiping a wibox
    
    When a wibox is destroyed or detached from a screen, it is wiped to clean up its
    resources. This also includes destroying the window which is associated with the
    wibox.
    
    The problem here is that if the wibox contains the systray, the systray window
    would automatically be destroyed since all childs of a window are destroyed when
    said window is destroyed. To fix this, we kick out the systray window before
    destroying the wibox' window.

    Naughty: Catch invalid markup in notifications
    
    Previously, an invalid markup caused an empty popup. Since the C core now throws
    a lua error on invalid markup, we have a way to notice that something is wrong.
    
    This patch first tries to set the notification's text the same way we did
    previously. If that fails, everything is escaped and the result is used as the
    text for the notification.

    Previously it returned a success which meant the next config file wasn't tried.

    Add all managed client windows to the safe set
    
    When an application loses its connection to the X11 server, all the windows in
    its save-set are saved by reparenting them back to their closest ancestor. Also,
    to they are unconditionally mapped. This second property is exactly what we
    need: All windows should be in mapped state, else the next window manager which
    starts up won't be managing them.
    
    This should fix all bugs where clients where lost due to a restart, yay! :)

    Add systray windows to the save-set
    
    When an X11 client disconnects from the X server, all of its windows are
    destroyed. This also means that all the sub-windows of those windows are
    destroyed which is not necessary what one wants to happen.
    
    To work around this, X11 has a "save-set". All the windows that are in the
    save-set are reparented to their closest ancestor when they would normally be
    destroyed. This is just what this code needs. :)
    
    (The windows in the save-set are also mapped when they are saved, dunno if this
    hurts here or not)

    Tasklist: Listen to the correct signals
    
    The tasklist shouldn't care about the tag history or new tags showing up and it
    also shouldn't care about tags disappearing on other screens (on the current
    screen the tasklist needs to update because the tag might have been selected).
    
    On the other hand, the tasklist really should care about tags being selected and
    unselected. This worked before because this causes changes to the focus history.

    Reorder some code for fullscreening windows
    
    When one sets a client to fullscreen, this is what currently happens:
    - lua code: c.fullscreen = true
    - The C code emits request::fullscreen without having touched the client's
      fullscreen property yet (c.fullscreen is still false)
    - awful.ewmh changes the client's geometry to fullscreen via c:geometry()
    - This causes property::geometry to be emitted
    - awful.layout reacts on this and causes the screen to be re-arranged, undoing
      the fullscreen geometry set in awful.ewmh
    - The C code for c.fullscreen = true continues and actually changes the client's
      fullscreen flag
    
    The result of this is that we get a client which thinks it is fullscreen'd
    without actually being that.
    
    Fix this by first changing the client's fullscreen property and then emitting
    request::fullscreen. Same thing for maximized_{vertical,horizontal}.
    
    Thanks to Jim Pryor for reporting this bug and helping reproducing it.

    xwindow_set_state(): Use uint32_t instead of long
    
    This function calls xcb_change_property() with format==32 which means that it is
    called with a 32-bit integer. However, on 64-bit machines, sizeof(long) == 64
    which means that this code did the wrong thing.
    
    This wasn't noticed before because it only causes a real difference on
    big-endian machines.

    This makes sure that an invalid value for this property doesn't cause the client
    to have no tag at all. This should be especially useful when one uses dynamic

    This will store the widgets references that the wibox have inside their

    This should fix FS#771.

    find this contribution useful.
    
    I also noticed that in the previous patch there is a line that was not
    supposed to be there, since its purpose was to help debugging the

    Basic support for manpages in multiple languages
    
    The patch changes the path where the manual pages are compiled, resulting in
    a tree structure that follows the man-db convention: the man pages of each
    language are stored in a subdirectory of the main man path. For example, the
    input file "$AWESOME_SRC/manpages/awesome.1.fr.txt" would be compiled as
    "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/fr/man1/awesome.1". The installation step just copies
    the resulting directory (in the example, "$BUILD_DIR/manpages/") into the
    global man path of the system, excluding the temporary files.
    
    The input .txt files for the translations are not added directly to
    AWE_MAN_FILES: instead, the new variable AWE_MAN_LANGS stores the language
    names and their input file names are generated automatically. The main
    reason of this modification is that it was more convenient for my testing
    purposes: this behaviour can be changed back with minor modifications to the
    code. This patch is supposed to be a first draft, after all, and it is far
    from being perfect, but I hope it is of help.

    Use WM_STATE_NORMAL as default
    
    If a window didn't have a WM_STATE set, xwindow_get_state_reply() returned 0
    which just happened to be XCB_WM_STATE_WITHDRAWN. This caused issues in scan().
    
    Instead, we now assume a window is in state normal if no state is explicitly
    set, which makes a lot more sense and fixes actual bugs.

    Check for UNMAPPED instead of UNVIEWABLE
    
    A window is unmapped if it is not mapped (oh noes! ;). If it is mapped, it can
    be either mapped or unviewable. If any of its ancestors is unmapped, it's
    unviewable, else it's unmapped
    
    Since this code looks at children of the root window, it should never be seeing
    clients which are unviewable (can one unmap the root window at all...?). What
    this really wants to check for is unmapped, so this patch implements this.

    awful.wibox: update struts on align()
    
    Setting width or height (horizontal or vertical) to an arbitrary value
    causes the wibox not to be stretched. Instead the align() function is
    called, which might not modify any wibox property in many situations,
    or none when align parameter was not provided by the user. The major
    side effect is that wibox struts were never updated and clients
    covered the wibox (until a first signal handler caused struts to be
    updated).

    Fix possible memory corruption (FS#734)
    
    The memory referred to by the reply argument of
    property_update_wm_protocols is automatically free'd
    by xcb later on, so it is not safe to simply use the
    value of reply in our own data structures. If we did
    this, future calls to xcb_get_wm_protocols_reply_wipe
    free the data which has already been free'd by xcb,
    causing a double-free and corrupting the heap. In
    addition, it isn't safe to use free'd memory as if
    it is still allocated. Instead, duplicate the data
    referred to by reply and use the duplicate instead.
    
    It seems to me as if the duplication should actually
    be done in xcb_get_wm_protocols_from_reply, but I'm
    not really sure. If that is the case, this is simply
    a work-around until xcb can be fixed.

    Commit 87070ca introduced support for access keys in menus. Chosen
    character was "&", an XML entity that has potential to cause problems;
    if a user tries to add multiple access keys or just put an ampersand
    in the name of the item the menu will break. Breaking happened because
    ampersands were not escaped - first one was substituted and the rest
    were ignored, but not escaped which triggered a pango markup error.

    client_focus_update(): Balance the lua stack
    
    There is a push 15 lines before the push that is removed here, but the client
    that is pushed there was never popped. Bad.
    
    Fix this by letting luaA_class_emit_signal() do the needed pop for us.

    awful.rules: fix client tagging with multiple screens
    
    Commit a757dda replaced the awful.client.movetotag call with c:tags()
    in the tag property handler. Which introduced a regression when more
    than one screen is used. The awful.tag.withcurrent function was being
    called even when there was a valid tag property. Now the clients
    screen is set to the tag screen to ensure the client is moved to the
    correct tag and screen.

    awful.autofocus: improve client focus with multiple screens
    
    Changing screen focus to an empty tag leaves focus on a client on the
    previous screen, if a tag with clients is focused next the focus
    remains on the previous screen. Now awful.autofocus compares the tag
    screen and clients screen to learn if the focus should be given to a
    client on the focused screen. Client that gets the focus is selected
    from history, as usual.

    wibox: fix align
    
    awful.wibox.align() in 3.4.x gets the available screen area from
    capi.screen[screen].geometry.
    
    this can easily result in overlapping wiboxes since the work area
    provided does not account for existing wiboxes.
    
    In my configuration I use a vertical wibox positioned at the
    right and it half-overlaps my top wibox because it is streched and
    hard-coded to align at the middle.

    Function wibox_update_strut would not take the border width into

    border nearest the screen edge and clients steal more and more space.

    Handle synthetic UnmapNotify events
    
    According to the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual, if you want to
    switch your window to withdrawn state, you unmap it and send a synthetic
    UnmapNotify to the root window.
    
    This synthetic event fixes a race condition. When you map and unmap a window
    quickly, the map will generate a MapRequest for the WM but won't actually map
    the window. Thus, the unmap will be discarded (-> window not yet mapped) and the
    window stays map once the WM handles the MapRequest
    
    Before this patch, awesome just ignored the synthetic unmap notify which caused
    the bug to appear again. With this patch it doesn't happen anymore.

    image: Use imlib2's image cache
    
    This makes imlib add images loaded from files to its image cache again. That way
    we avoid loading the same image again and again (e.g. if you cycle through the
    list layouts all the layout icons are loaded).
    
    To not reintroduce FS#651 (fixed in 2dadce9b), we call
    imlib_image_set_changes_on_disk(). This causes two stat() calls if the same file
    is loaded again to check if the file's timestamps changed which is still less
    expensive than loading the whole image again.

    wibox: make sure no garbage is painted to the screen
    
    Wiboxes are lazily updated. This means that we could receive an expose event on
    them between making them visible and actually painting their content.
    
    Due to this we were copying undefined content to the wibox, because the pixmap
    was only created just now, but it wasn't actually filled with anything yet.

    Set a wibox' bit gravity to NorthWest.
    
    After the last patch, after each resize the X server fills the complete wibox
    with its background color which means that the widgets will still flicker. This
    patch fixes this by setting the wibox' bit gravity to NorthWest.
    
    This means that if a wibox is enlarged, only the new, larger part will be filled
    with the wibox' background color and the rest of the wibox' content will be left
    intact. With this patch I couldn't see any flickering anymore.

    wibox: Set a proper back pixel
    
    Currently wiboxes have their background set to "inherit parent pixmap". That
    means that each time a wibox is e.g. resized, the X server sets the wibox'
    content to the wallpaper and then immediately awesome redraws the wibox with the
    proper background. This causes flicker when you e.g. resize clients which have a
    titlebar.
    
    With this patch, wiboxes get their proper background color for their "back
    pixel" value. Now, instead of showing the wallpaper, the X server will fill the
    complete wibox with its background color.
    
    With this patch, the actual widgets will still flicker. Also, if the wibox has a
    background image, this image obviously won't be used by the X server and we get
    some flicker again. My next patch will address these issues.
