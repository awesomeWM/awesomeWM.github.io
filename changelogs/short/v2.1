Aldo Cortesi (43):
      Vim swap file in .gitignore
      Add doc to .gitignore.
      Fix crashing bug triggered through awesome-client
      Use strtok in run_uicb, in preparation for improving error reporting.
      Add a warn utility function, and use it to improve error reporting in run_uicb.
      Use warn function throughout project.
      Add a way to define key bindings in bulk, like this:
      Remove some redundant gcc flags.
      Comment typos.
      Remove inline declarations in client.h - these don't match what's in the the .c     anyway.
      Improve the call signature of get_current_tag and get_current_layout.
      Refactor draw.c
      Remove stubs for reloadconfig.
      Refactor statusbar.c
      Widget-ise the statusbar.
      Fix compilation warning related to parsing of statusbar widgets config.
      Massive, massive interface refactoring.
      Various doc comment fixes.
      Fix compiler warning re unused argument, and improve the function interface     while we're at it.
      Simplify widget draw interface.
      The beginnings of a more flexible widget configuration.
      Solidify widgets.
      Make empty status bar look nice.
      Add basic framework for uicb_widget_tell. For now, it does nothing, but stay     tuned.
      The arg to uicb_ functions is no longer const.
      Refactor the focus.c interface to use globalconf.
      Add more requirements to README.
      Use WidgetList for lookups, rather than recreating the data.
      This patch is a first draft of independently targetable textboxes, and a     protocol to speak to them. Given a textbox widget definition like this:
      Make drawtext interface more general.
      Make "Statusbar statusbar" the  in VirtScreen "Statusbar *statusbar". This is     more consistent with the rest of the interface, and will make our life easier     when we have mulitiple statusbars per screen.
      Continue to simplify interfaces that require arguments in globalconf.     Today I focus on screen.c.
      The preferred line length is 80 characters.
      Make textbox foreground and background configurable.
      Remove single occurance of die, and then remove die itself.
      Documentation generation fixes.
      Make sure all uicb_ functions have doxygen annotations.
      Make doxygen documentation less cluttered.
      Change awesome_config -> AwesomeConf.
      Clean interface of statusbar_init.
      Remove un-needed function.
      Clean interface of statusbar_update_position.
      Clean get_screen_info and get_display_info.
